In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results and cash flow as a result of changes in the level of demand for our products and services, the level of our operating expenses, the amount and timing of our capital expenditures, the amount and timing of our acquisitions and divestitures, the level of our working capital requirements, the level of our accounts receivable and payable, and the level of our accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nSome of the key factors that contribute to the fluctuations in our operating results and cash flow include:\n\n*   The seasonality of our business, including the impact of holidays, weather patterns, and other seasonal factors on demand for our products and services;\n*   The cyclical nature of our industry, including the impact of economic downturns, changes in government regulations, and other factors on demand for our products and services;\n*   The level of competition in our market, including the impact of new entrants, changes in pricing and other competitive factors on our operating results;\n*   The level of our investment in research and development, including the impact of new product and service introductions on our operating expenses;\n*   The level of our investment in sales and marketing, including the impact of new marketing campaigns and other sales and marketing initiatives on our operating expenses.\n\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our operating results and cash flow in the past and may experience fluctuations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur ability to manage these fluctuations will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\n*   Develop and implement effective business planning and budgeting processes, including our ability to forecast our operating results and cash flow accurately;\n*   Maintain a strong balance sheet, including our ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations, invest in our business, and make strategic acquisitions;\n*   Manage our working capital requirements effectively, including our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions with our suppliers, partners, and other third parties;\n*   Develop and implement effective risk management processes, including our ability to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with our business.\n\nIf we are unable to manage these fluctuations effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the market.\n\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position in the market will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\n*   Innovate and develop new products and services, including our ability to identify emerging trends and technologies;\n*   Invest in research and development, including our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services;\n*   Attract and retain key personnel, including experienced management, sales and marketing, and technical professionals;\n*   Maintain our relationships with our suppliers, partners, and other third parties, including our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions.\n\nIf we are unable to maintain our competitive position in the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions and divestitures as part of our business strategy.

The net interest margin was 2.02%, down 5 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by a decline in the yield on earning assets.\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter was $7.8 billion, down $214 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment fees, and other income. Mortgage banking revenue was $1.3 billion, down $143 million from the second quarter of 2022, driven by lower mortgage origination and servicing revenue.\n\nCredit Losses\n\nCredit losses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up $215 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher credit losses in the consumer and commercial portfolios. The allowance for credit losses was $14.5 billion, up $550 million from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the consumer and commercial portfolios.\n\nEfficiency Ratio\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.3%, down 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by a decline in noninterest expenses. Noninterest expenses were $10.6 billion, down $417 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower salaries, benefits, and other expenses.\n\nReturn on Average Common Equity\n\nThe return on average common equity for the quarter was 12.3%, up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in net income.\n\nCapital and Liquidity\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. The company\u2019s liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 134%, up 5 percentage points from the second quarter of 2022.\n\nESG Initiatives\n\nWells Fargo continued to make progress on its ESG initiatives, including its goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The company has set a target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and has implemented various initiatives to achieve this goal, including increasing its use of renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, and promoting sustainable transportation.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWells Fargo is committed to increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion across its organization. The company has set a goal to increase diversity in its workforce and has implemented various initiatives to achieve this goal, including diversity and inclusion training, mentorship programs, and diversity and inclusion metrics.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s business segments include Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management.\n\nConsumer Banking and Lending\n\nNet income for the Consumer Banking and Lending segment was $2.4 billion, down $135 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net interest income and higher credit losses.\n\nCommercial Banking\n\nNet income for the Commercial Banking segment was $1.4 billion, up $85 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher net interest income and lower credit losses.\n\nCorporate and Investment Banking\n\nNet income for the Corporate and Investment Banking segment was $1.2 billion, down $45 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net interest income and higher noninterest expenses.\n\nWealth and Investment Management\n\nNet income for the Wealth and Investment Management segment was $844 million, up $53 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher net interest income and lower noninterest expenses.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements about Wells Fargo\u2019s future financial performance and business.

We believe these amounts are not material.\n\nThe following is a summary of the changes in our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, and accrued expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $12.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the net use of cash for operating activities, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our ATM Program and our 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. This decrease in cash and cash equivalents was largely driven by increased spending in research and development, as well as higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Specifically, our research and development expenses increased by $10.2 million, or 15.1%, primarily due to increased personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as higher consulting and outside services expenses.
