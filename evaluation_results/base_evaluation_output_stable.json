This budget allocation is intended to support our strategic growth initiatives, including investments in research and development, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions.\n\nOur cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $3.5 billion, which was lower than the $4.4 billion generated in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $1.2 billion decrease in cash generated from operations related to changes in our working capital accounts. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including the $1.2 billion increase in accrued expenses, as well as a decrease in our accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in our cash generated from the sale of our investments. The increase in accrued expenses was largely driven by higher costs associated with our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses.\n\nOur cash flow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $(1.5) billion, which was higher than the $(1.3) billion generated in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the $1.5 billion purchase of our 9.8% ownership interest in TCI. This investment is expected to provide strategic benefits and potential long-term returns on investment.

The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the $1.1 billion decrease in cash dividends paid to our stockholders. We also repaid $300 million of debt during the year, which reduced our outstanding debt balance and associated interest expense. Additionally, we repurchased $400 million of our common stock under our share repurchase program, which reduced our outstanding share count and returned value to our stockholders.\n\nWe expect to continue to generate cash from operations and use it to fund our business needs, including funding our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses, as well as repaying debt and funding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We also expect to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend policy is to pay a regular quarterly dividend that reflects our financial performance and cash generation, while also considering our future business needs and growth opportunities.\n\nWe expect to continue to generate cash from operations in the future, but the amount of cash generated will depend on a number of factors, including the level of demand for our products and services, the level of capital expenditures, the level of research and development spending, the level of investments in our businesses, the level of debt repayment, and the level of funding of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to borrow funds to meet our business needs, including funding our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses.\n\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed to ensure that we have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to meet our business needs, including funding our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses. We maintain a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility that provides us with access to additional liquidity if needed. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand, which provides us with flexibility to respond to changing business conditions and opportunities.\n\nWe regularly review our capital allocation strategy to ensure that we are allocating our capital in a way that maximizes long-term value for our stockholders.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe Company has a significant exposure to foreign currency risk primarily due to the Company\u2019s international operations and its use of foreign currencies for transactions, including foreign currency denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and certain intercompany transactions. The Company\u2019s foreign currency exposure is primarily to the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, and the Chinese Renminbi. The Company uses foreign currencies to fund its international operations and to settle transactions with foreign counterparties.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $4.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, which are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company\u2019s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates would result in a change in the fair value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $420 million and $330 million, respectively.\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company\u2019s foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are used to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company\u2019s operating results. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts of approximately $1.1 billion, with an average maturity of approximately 12 months. The notional value of these contracts represents the maximum amount of foreign currency that the Company is obligated to purchase or sell at the specified exchange rate. The Company\u2019s foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nIn addition to foreign currency forward contracts, the Company also enters into foreign currency options to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company\u2019s foreign currency options are not designated as hedges and are used to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company\u2019s operating results. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign currency options of approximately $1.1 billion, with an average maturity of approximately 12 months. The Company\u2019s foreign currency options give the Company the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell foreign currencies at a specified exchange rate. The Company\u2019s foreign currency options are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to its variable rate debt and its investments in floating rate securities. The Company\u2019s variable rate debt includes its revolving credit facilities and term loans, which are subject to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding variable rate debt of approximately $2.5 billion, with an average interest rate of 4.5%. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would result in a change in the Company\u2019s interest expense of approximately $25 million per year.\n\nTo manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps. The Company\u2019s interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges and are used to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Company\u2019s operating results. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps of approximately $1.4 billion, with an average maturity of approximately 12 months. The notional value of these swaps represents the maximum amount of interest that the Company is obligated to pay or receive at the specified interest rate. The Company\u2019s interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe Company\u2019s sensitivity analysis is based on a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis is based on the current level of outstanding contracts and is based on the assumption that the contracts will remain outstanding for the next 12 months. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the following table:\n\n|  | Hypothetical 10% Change |\n| --- | --- |\n| Foreign Currency Denominated Assets | $420 million |\n| Foreign Currency Denominated Liabilities | $330 million |\n| Interest Expense | $25 million |\n\nThe Company believes that its use of foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps is effective in managing its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. However, the Company\u2019s use of these financial instruments does not eliminate the risk of foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, and there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s use of these instruments will be effective in the future.\n\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps is estimated using widely accepted valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes model for options and the income approach for forward contracts and swaps. The inputs to these models are observable market data, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, and are subject to changes in market conditions. The Company believes that its estimates of fair value are reasonable and are based on the best available information. However, the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments is subject to changes in market conditions and may not be indicative of the actual value that the Company would receive if it were to settle these instruments.\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk is monitored and managed by the Company\u2019s treasury department, which is responsible for identifying and mitigating financial risks. The Company\u2019s treasury department uses a variety of tools, including financial models and market data, to monitor and analyze the Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. The Company\u2019s treasury department also works closely with the Company\u2019s business units to understand their financial risks and to develop strategies to mitigate those risks.\n\nIn conclusion, the Company is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risk due to its international operations and use of foreign currencies and variable rate debt. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to these risks. While the Company believes that its use of these financial instruments is effective in managing its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s use of these instruments will be effective in the future. output: ITEM 7A.

Revenue is recorded at the amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when the products are shipped to customers, and the Company has a signed sales agreement or purchase order from the customer that includes the terms of the sale, including the price and payment terms. Revenue from services is recognized as the services are performed, and the Company has a signed services agreement or statement of work that outlines the scope of the work, the price, and payment terms.\n\nThe Company also generates revenue from licensing agreements, which is recognized over the term of the license agreement based on the terms of the agreement. Revenue from royalties is recognized when earned, based on the terms of the royalty agreement.\n\nThe Company records revenue net of sales taxes, returns, and discounts. The Company also records revenue from sales of extended warranties and maintenance agreements over the term of the agreement.\n\nB. Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in checking and savings accounts with reputable financial institutions.\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents also include amounts held in money market funds, which are highly liquid and low-risk investments that are designed to preserve principal while providing liquidity. The Company's money market funds are primarily invested in commercial paper and other low-risk investments.\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents are recorded at fair value, which is the amount that the Company could receive in exchange for those assets in the market. The Company does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk associated with its cash and cash equivalents.\n\nC. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the net amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience of doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is written off against the related accounts receivable when it is determined that the account balance is unlikely to be collected. The Company also considers the creditworthiness of its customers, industry trends and current economic conditions in determining its allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\nThe Company's allowance for doubtful accounts was $12.5 million and $14.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to the improvement in the credit quality of the Company's customers and the overall economic conditions.\n\nThe Company also has a reserve for returns and discounts, which is recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable. The reserve for returns and discounts is based on the Company's historical experience and is recorded at the time of sale.\n\nD. Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company also maintains a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical experience and management's judgment of future demand for the products.\n\nThe Company reviews its inventories regularly to identify any excess or obsolete items. The Company considers factors such as inventory levels, sales trends, and changes in customer demand when determining whether inventory is excess or obsolete. The Company writes off inventory that is deemed excess or obsolete, and the cost is recorded as a charge to cost of sales.\n\nThe Company's inventories are primarily composed of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. The Company's inventory levels are managed to meet customer demand while minimizing the risk of excess or obsolete inventory.\n\nE. Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 40 years. The Company also maintains a reserve for asset retirement obligations.\n\nThe Company's property, plant and equipment are primarily composed of machinery and equipment, buildings and improvements, and vehicles. The Company's assets are depreciated based on their estimated useful lives, and the depreciation expense is recorded as a charge to operating expenses.\n\nThe Company also has a program to maintain and upgrade its property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalizes costs associated with the upgrade and maintenance of its assets, and the costs are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nF. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their fair value and are not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may be impaired. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the Company records an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\nThe Company also tests intangible assets for impairment at the individual asset level. Intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then the Company records an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nThe Company's goodwill and intangible assets are primarily composed of acquired trademarks, patents, and customer relationships. The Company's goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their fair value, which is determined based on the acquisition price and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\" output: \"A. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the products are shipped to customers, and the Company has a signed sales agreement or purchase order from the customer that includes the terms of the sale, including the price and payment terms.

The allowance for credit losses was $14.5 billion, up $550 million from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the consumer and commercial portfolios.\n\nEfficiency Ratio\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.3%, down 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by a decline in noninterest expenses. Noninterest expenses were $10.6 billion, down $417 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower salaries, benefits, and other expenses.\n\nReturn on Average Common Equity\n\nThe return on average common equity for the quarter was 12.3%, up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in net income.\n\nCapital and Liquidity\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2022.

The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness.

We have issued commercial paper of up to $10.0 billion in aggregate principal amount. As of December 31, 2022, $5.6 billion of commercial paper was outstanding. This commercial paper is primarily used to fund our operational needs, such as inventory and accounts receivable, and we generally repay these borrowings within a short period, typically within 90 days. The interest rates on our commercial paper are determined by market conditions and our credit rating, and we closely monitor our commercial paper borrowings to minimize the costs of these financings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $13.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $2.3 billion of cash held in foreign subsidiaries. The cash held in foreign subsidiaries is generally used to fund our international operations and is subject to certain repatriation restrictions and foreign withholding taxes.

However, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity in the future to meet our long-term financial obligations or that our financial obligations will not exceed our cash and cash equivalents or our available borrowing capacity.\n\nOur cash flows from operating activities are influenced by a number of factors, including our operating performance, the timing of capital expenditures, and the level of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities. We generate cash from the sale of our products and services, and our primary use of cash is to fund our operations and make capital expenditures. We use cash generated from our operations to fund our capital expenditures, including the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We also use cash generated from our operations to fund our research and development activities, which are critical to our long-term growth and competitiveness.\n\nIn 2022, our cash flows from operating activities were $10.5 billion, which was primarily driven by our net income of $8.5 billion and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization of $2.2 billion. We also generated $1.3 billion of cash from the sale of certain assets and businesses, which was partially offset by $0.5 billion of cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures in 2022 were $3.5 billion, which was primarily focused on investing in our manufacturing capabilities and technology infrastructure.\n\nWe expect our cash flows from operating activities to continue to be influenced by a number of factors, including the timing of capital expenditures, the level of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities, and the level of our cash dividends to shareholders. Our ability to generate cash from our operations is influenced by a number of factors, including the level of demand for our products and services, the level of our operating income, and the level of our capital expenditures. We closely monitor our cash flows and adjust our capital expenditures and dividend payments as needed to ensure that we maintain a strong liquidity position.\n\nWe believe that our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and projected financial obligations for the next twelve months. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows from operating activities in the future to meet our financial obligations or that our financial obligations will not exceed our cash flows from operating activities. We regularly review our cash flows and liquidity position to ensure that we have sufficient funds to meet our financial obligations and to invest in our business to drive long-term growth.\n\nIn addition to our cash flows from operating activities, we also have access to various sources of financing, including our credit facilities and the debt capital markets. We have a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poor's and A3 from Moody's, which provides us with access to the debt capital markets at favorable interest rates. We closely monitor our credit ratings and take steps to maintain a strong credit profile, which is critical to our ability to access the debt capital markets and to maintain our liquidity position.\n\nOverall, we believe that our strong liquidity position, combined with our ability to generate cash from our operations and access to various sources of financing, will enable us to meet our current and projected financial obligations and to invest in our business to drive long-term growth.\" output: \"Our cash flows from operating activities were $10.5 billion, which was primarily driven by our net income of $8.5 billion and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization of $2.2 billion.

The Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with its customers is critical to its success, as a significant portion of its revenue is derived from a relatively small number of large customers. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the price of oil, natural gas, and other commodities, which may impact the Company\u2019s operating results, including its ability to recover costs and maintain profitability. The Company is also affected by the impact of inflation on its operating expenses and the availability of financing, which may impact its ability to maintain its current level of operations. For example, an increase in the price of oil could lead to higher production costs, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability. Similarly, an increase in inflation could lead to higher operating expenses, which could also negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro and the Chinese Yuan. The Company has significant operations in Europe and Asia, and changes in the value of the US dollar relative to these currencies can impact the Company\u2019s revenue and expenses. For example, a strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro could lead to lower revenue from European operations, as the Company\u2019s products and services become more expensive for European customers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, on the Company\u2019s operations, including the impact on the Company\u2019s supply chain and the availability of financing.

The Company has significant debt and equity obligations, and changes in the Company\u2019s financial position can impact its ability to access financing and maintain its current level of operations.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s tax position, including the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, and the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and changes in tax laws and regulations can impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit assets.

The Company is subject to numerous accounting standards and regulations, and changes in these standards and regulations can impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s internal controls and procedures, including the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, and the impact of changes in the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures.

Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Lender has agreed to provide the Company with a senior secured term loan in the original principal amount of $500,000,000 (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and a senior secured revolving loan facility in the original principal amount of $100,000,000 (the \u201cRevolving Loan Facility\u201d and together with the Term Loan, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d).\n\nThe Company will use the proceeds of the Term Loan to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Company\u2019s existing term loan and revolving loan facilities, and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Credit Facility. Specifically, the Company will utilize approximately $350,000,000 of the Term Loan proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balance of its existing term loan facility, with the remaining amount used to repay the outstanding principal balance of its existing revolving loan facility and to cover fees and expenses associated with the Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company will use the proceeds of the Revolving Loan Facility to fund its working capital requirements, including, without limitation, for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper, and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Credit Facility. The Revolving Loan Facility is expected to provide the Company with additional liquidity and flexibility to manage its working capital needs, particularly during periods of increased demand or when the Company requires additional funds to support its growth initiatives.\n\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default. The covenants include, among others, a requirement that the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) will not exceed 3.25:1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company. The consolidated leverage ratio is calculated by dividing the Company\u2019s consolidated total debt by its consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). This covenant is designed to ensure that the Company maintains a manageable level of debt relative to its earnings.\n\nIn addition, the Loan Agreement includes a covenant that the Company\u2019s consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) will not be less than 3.25:1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company. The consolidated interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the Company\u2019s consolidated EBITDA by its consolidated interest expense. This covenant is intended to ensure that the Company has sufficient earnings to cover its interest payments.\n\nThe Loan Agreement is secured by a lien on the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the Company\u2019s real property, substantially all of the Company\u2019s personal property, including, without limitation, the Company\u2019s intellectual property, and all of the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 other assets, including, without limitation, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and property, plant and equipment. This security interest provides the Lender with a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, ensuring that the Lender has a secured interest in the event of default.\n\nThe Company\u2019s obligations under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries. The guarantor subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for the Company\u2019s obligations under the Loan Agreement, providing the Lender with additional credit support.\n\nThe Company is required to pay interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Credit Facility at a rate equal to the applicable margin (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus the base rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The applicable margin is a percentage that varies based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio, with a lower margin applicable if the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio is below certain thresholds. The base rate is a floating rate that is tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the prime rate, depending on the Company\u2019s election.\n\nIn addition to interest, the Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Credit Facility, including a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Loan Facility and a letter of credit fee on any outstanding letters of credit. The Company is also required to pay a ticking fee on the Term Loan if it is not repaid within a certain timeframe.\n\nThe Loan Agreement has a maturity date of April 14, 2029, for the Term Loan and April 14, 2027, for the Revolving Loan Facility. The Company may prepay the Term Loan at any time without penalty, subject to certain notice requirements. The Revolving Loan Facility may be terminated by the Company at any time, subject to certain notice requirements, and the Company may reduce the commitment amount of the Revolving Loan Facility at any time, subject to certain minimum thresholds.\n\nOverall, the Credit Facility provides the Company with a flexible and cost-effective financing solution that supports its growth initiatives and working capital requirements. The Company believes that the terms of the Loan Agreement are reasonable and consistent with market standards for similar credit facilities. output: ITEM 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.\n\nThe Company intends to use the proceeds of the Credit Facility to fund its working capital needs, including, without limitation, for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper, and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Credit Facility.\n\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default.

These risks may be exacerbated by climate change. In addition, certain of our operations are located in areas that are prone to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods, and may be more susceptible to damage or disruption as a result. For example, our facilities in coastal regions may be at a higher risk of flooding and storm surges, while our operations in areas with high seismic activity may be more vulnerable to earthquakes. In addition, the occurrence of such events could result in damage to our facilities, interruption of our supply chain, loss of our employees and other personnel, and other disruptions to our business. We may not be able to recover from such events in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, any of these events could result in a loss of our key personnel, which could harm our business.\n\nIn particular, our manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and other critical infrastructure may be at risk of damage or disruption due to natural disasters or other catastrophic events. If any of these facilities are damaged or destroyed, we may not be able to operate at full capacity, or at all, until repairs or replacements can be made. This could result in significant losses, including lost revenue, increased costs, and potential liability for any resulting harm to our customers, employees, or other stakeholders. Furthermore, if we are unable to restore our operations quickly, our customers may seek alternative suppliers, which could lead to long-term losses of business and revenue.\n\nIn addition, we may experience a loss of business or reputational harm if we fail to adequately respond to any such events or if we fail to prevent or mitigate the impact of any such events. For example, if we fail to implement adequate emergency response plans, or if our response to a disaster is perceived as inadequate or insensitive, we may face criticism and reputational damage. In addition, any of these events could result in a significant increase in the cost of insurance coverage for our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The occurrence of such events may also impact the availability and cost of materials, labor, and supplies necessary to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For instance, if a natural disaster disrupts the supply chain for critical components or raw materials, we may face increased costs or shortages, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.\n\nThe occurrence of such events may also cause a significant increase in the cost of capital, including the cost of debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, if investors perceive our business as being at higher risk due to the occurrence of a catastrophic event, they may demand higher returns on investment, which could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\n\nWe have not maintained adequate insurance coverage for certain risks that may impact our business. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate or sufficient to cover our losses or damages if any of these events occur. For example, we may not have adequate coverage for business interruption, cyber-attacks, or other types of losses that could result from a catastrophic event. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or may be unable to obtain such coverage at a reasonable cost. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we may be subject to material losses, including potential liability for the cost of any such events, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nIn particular, we may not have adequate insurance coverage for losses related to climate change, such as sea level rise, more frequent or severe weather events, or other climate-related risks. As climate change continues to evolve and intensify, we may face increased risks and uncertainties, including physical risks to our facilities and operations, as well as transition risks related to changes in regulations, technologies, and market conditions.\n\nFurthermore, even if we do have adequate insurance coverage, we may still face significant costs and disruptions in the event of a catastrophic event. For example, we may need to pay deductibles, coinsurance, or other expenses out of pocket, which could be significant. Additionally, we may face delays or disputes with our insurers, which could impact our ability to recover losses or damages in a timely manner. In any case, the occurrence of a catastrophic event could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could potentially threaten our long-term viability.\" output: \"the risk of material damage or loss, and may be subject to various risks and uncertainties, including weather conditions, damage from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, fires, tornadoes, droughts, and other weather-related events, and damage from other disasters, such as pandemic outbreaks, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, and other catastrophic events.

This decrease in cash and cash equivalents was largely driven by increased spending in research and development, as well as higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Specifically, our research and development expenses increased by $10.2 million, or 15.1%, primarily due to increased personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as higher consulting and outside services expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8.5 million, or 14.2%, primarily due to higher personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as increased marketing and advertising expenses.\n\nThe net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our ATM Program were $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which helped to partially offset the net use of cash for operating activities. Additionally, our 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated $4.2 million in net proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2023. These proceeds helped to support our ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $23.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the net use of cash for operating activities, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our ATM Program and our 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Similar to 2023, our research and development expenses increased by $8.5 million, or 14.1%, primarily due to increased personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as higher consulting and outside services expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.2 million, or 13.5%, primarily due to higher personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as increased marketing and advertising expenses.\n\nThe net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our ATM Program were $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which helped to partially offset the net use of cash for operating activities. Additionally, our 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated $3.5 million in net proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2022. These proceeds helped to support our ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased $34.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our ATM Program and our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, partially offset by the net use of cash for operating activities. Our research and development expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 10.3%, primarily due to increased personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as higher consulting and outside services expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.5 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to higher personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, as well as increased marketing and advertising expenses.\n\nThe net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our ATM Program were $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which helped to drive the increase in cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated $5.0 million in net proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2021. These proceeds helped to support our ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.\n\nAccounts receivable\n\nAccounts receivable decreased $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable from customers, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable from the U.S. government. The decrease in accounts receivable from customers was largely driven by improved collections and a reduction in days sales outstanding. Our days sales outstanding decreased by 10 days, from 65 days at December 31, 2022 to 55 days at December 31, 2023, primarily due to improved billing and collections processes.\n\nThe increase in accounts receivable from the U.S. government was largely driven by an increase in contract awards and funding. Our U.S. government contracts increased by $10.0 million, or 15.4%, primarily due to an increase in contract awards and funding for our research and development programs.\n\nAccounts receivable decreased $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable from customers, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable from the U.S. government.

Our days sales outstanding decreased by 12 days, from 72 days at December 31, 2021 to 60 days at December 31, 2022, primarily due to improved billing and collections processes.\n\nThe increase in accounts receivable from the U.S. government was largely driven by an increase in contract awards and funding. Our U.S. government contracts increased by $8.0 million, or 14.5%, primarily due to an increase in contract awards and funding for our research and development programs.\n\nAccounts receivable increased $22.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable from customers. The increase in accounts receivable from customers was largely driven by an increase in sales and an increase in days sales outstanding. Our days sales outstanding increased by 10 days, from 62 days at December 31, 2020 to 72 days at December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in sales and a slower pace of collections.\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses increased $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses to customers and an increase in accrued expenses to suppliers, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses to employees. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses to customers was largely driven by an increase in sales and an increase in days payable outstanding. Our days payable outstanding increased by 10 days, from 45 days at December 31, 2022 to 55 days at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in sales and a slower pace of payments.\n\nThe increase in accrued expenses to suppliers was largely driven by an increase in purchases and an increase in days payable outstanding.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause significant disruptions to our business and operations, including disruptions to our supply chain, including the potential for the temporary shutdown of certain of our manufacturing facilities, and to the business and operations of our customers, including disruptions to their supply chain. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs and expenses, including costs and expenses related to, among other things, business continuity plans, remote work arrangements, and increased costs and expenses related to the health and well-being of our employees. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant changes to the way that we operate our business, including the implementation of remote work arrangements and business continuity plans, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThese disruptions and changes have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to generate revenue, as certain of our customers have been and may continue to be affected by the pandemic, leading to reduced demand for our products. Additionally, the pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs and expenses related to logistics and transportation, as well as increased lead times for certain raw materials and components. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused and may continue to cause us to incur additional costs and expenses related to the procurement of personal protective equipment and other safety measures for our employees.\n\nOur ability to generate cash flows to service our debt or to refinance our debt as it matures is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to generate cash from operations and to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms. Our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to generate revenue, our ability to manage our expenses, and our ability to generate cash from the sale of assets. Our ability to refinance our debt is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to generate cash from operations, the ability of our subsidiaries to generate cash from operations, the ability of our subsidiaries to generate cash from the sale of assets, and the availability of capital markets.\n\nIn addition, our ability to generate cash from operations and to refinance our debt may be affected by a number of factors, including the availability and cost of capital, changes in interest rates, changes in the credit markets, and changes in the overall economic environment. Moreover, our ability to generate cash from operations may be impacted by the collectibility of our accounts receivable, the salability of our inventory, and the recoverability of our assets. Our ability to refinance our debt may also be impacted by the creditworthiness of our subsidiaries, the value of the collateral securing our debt, and the willingness of lenders to provide financing.\n\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt or to refinance our debt as it matures, we may be forced to take certain actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing or eliminating dividends, or selling assets. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, we may be forced to accept terms that are less favorable than our existing debt, which could increase our interest expense and reduce our cash flows.\n\nAs of the date of this Form 10-Q, we have taken various steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including the implementation of business continuity plans and remote work arrangements. However, the pandemic is ongoing, and its impact on our business and operations is uncertain and may continue to evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation and take steps to mitigate its impact, but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful.\n\nSee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry\u2014The COVID-19 pandemic and other public health issues may negatively impact our business and operations and our financial results and condition, and the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our ability to generate cash flows to service our debt or to refinance our debt as it matures\u201d in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn light of these factors, we believe that our ability to generate cash flows to service our debt or to refinance our debt as it matures is critical to our financial health and stability. We will continue to closely monitor our cash flows and debt levels and take steps to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\" output: \"other\" category, which includes, among other things, the potential for the occurrence of unforeseen events such as natural disasters, the potential for a global pandemic, and the potential for a global economic downturn.

These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends, and various assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe Company\u2019s significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These policies include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, intangible assets, and income taxes.

The Company adopted ASU No. 2022-04 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The adoption of ASU No. 2022-04 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separately present the foreign currency basis of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and instead requires an entity to present all foreign currency items in a fair value hierarchy. The new guidance also updates the guidance on the classification of foreign currency items in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU No. 2022-05 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The adoption of ASU No. 2022-05 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $1,320, which were comprised of deferred tax assets of $1,831, offset by deferred tax liabilities of $511. The deferred tax assets were primarily related to depreciation and amortization, accruals and reserves, and net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax liabilities were primarily related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized, and to the extent that realization is not considered more likely than not, a valuation allowance is established. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of $14 against its deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is primarily related to state and local tax net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized.\n\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the following:\n\n- State and local taxes: The Company is subject to state and local taxes in various jurisdictions, which range from 0% to 8.25%. The state and local tax rates are applied to the Company's taxable income in each jurisdiction, resulting in a blended state and local tax rate of 4.2%, 4.1%, and 4.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\n- Foreign taxes: The Company is subject to foreign taxes in various jurisdictions, which range from 0% to 25%. The foreign tax rates are applied to the Company's taxable income in each jurisdiction, resulting in a blended foreign tax rate of 0%, 0%, and 0% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\n- Permanent differences: The Company has permanent differences between its financial statement income and taxable income, primarily related to nondeductible executive compensation, non-qualified stock options, and certain types of income that are not subject to tax.\n\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the benefit of the gain on the sale of a subsidiary, which was recorded in 2022. The gain on the sale of a subsidiary was subject to a lower tax rate than the U.S. federal statutory rate, resulting in a lower effective income tax rate for the year.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1,135 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized, would favorably affect the Company's effective income tax rate. The gross unrecognized tax benefits were primarily related to the deductibility of certain expenses, the classification of certain transactions, and the valuation of certain assets. The Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months.\n\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefits of open tax years in the financial statements in the period in which the benefits are realized or forfeited. The Company recognizes tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including any related interest and penalties, based on management's judgment utilizing currently available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities for the years 2019 through 2022. The Company does not believe that there are any material positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that would result in the recognition of a liability for interest and penalties.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1,135 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized, would favorably affect the Company's effective income tax rate.\n\nThe Company's management assesses the available evidence to estimate whether some or all of the gross unrecognized tax benefits will be realized. The Company's management considers, among other factors, the guidance provided by ASC 740, the technical merits of its tax positions, and the potential settlement of tax audits and examinations. The Company's management exercises significant judgment in determining the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, and the amount of the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. output: ...not believe that there are any material positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that would result in the recognition of a liability for interest and penalties.\n\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the following:\n\n- State and local taxes: The Company is subject to state and local taxes in various jurisdictions, which range from 0% to 8.25%.

All of our foreign currency swaps and forward contracts were entered into in accordance with our foreign exchange risk management policy.\n\nWe use a combination of forward contracts and swaps to hedge our foreign exchange exposure. Forward contracts are used to hedge specific transactions, while swaps are used to hedge our overall foreign exchange exposure. We also use options to hedge our foreign exchange exposure, but to a lesser extent.\n\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is designed to minimize the potential for losses and gains from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We use a combination of financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure, including forward contracts, swaps, and options. We also use natural hedges, such as offsetting foreign currency positions, to reduce our foreign exchange exposure.\n\nWe monitor our foreign exchange exposure on a regular basis and adjust our hedging strategy as necessary. We also review our foreign exchange risk management policy on a regular basis to ensure that it is effective in managing our foreign exchange risk.\n\nIn 2023, we experienced a net gain of $123,456 from our foreign exchange hedging activities. This gain was primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In 2022, we experienced a net loss of $90,123 from our foreign exchange hedging activities. This loss was primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro.\n\nWe expect to continue to experience foreign exchange gains and losses in the future due to the volatility of foreign exchange rates. However, we believe that our foreign exchange risk management program is effective in minimizing the potential for losses and gains from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is determined using a valuation model that takes into account the current market prices of the underlying currencies. The fair value of our foreign currency options is determined using a valuation model that takes into account the current market prices of the underlying currencies, as well as the volatility of the currencies.\n\nThe fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and swaps is included in the \u201cOther assets\u201d and \u201cOther liabilities\u201d sections of the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our foreign currency options is included in the \u201cOther assets\u201d section of the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe believe that our foreign exchange risk management program is effective in managing our foreign exchange risk. We continue to monitor our foreign exchange exposure and adjust our hedging strategy as necessary to minimize the potential for losses and gains from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. output: Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce the potential for losses and gains from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates.

The Company is currently in compliance with these restrictive covenants. However, the Company's ability to comply with these covenants in the future will depend on various factors, including the Company's ability to generate revenue and maintain profitability, the Company's ability to collect accounts receivable, the Company's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and access capital markets, and the Company's ability to maintain compliance with other covenants under the Term Loan Facility.\n\nThe Company's failure to comply with the financial covenants or restrictive covenants under the Term Loan Facility could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to restore compliance with the covenants or maintain compliance with the covenants in the future.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility was $150 million. The Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of $2.5 million from the first anniversary of the Term Loan Facility drawdown date until the maturity date in 2026. The Company is also required to make interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility at a rate of 6.5% per annum. The interest payments are due quarterly and are calculated based on the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility.\n\nThe Company's ability to make payments under the Term Loan Facility will depend on the Company's ability to generate cash in the future. The Company's management team is working to improve the Company's financial performance and increase its cash reserves. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash to make the required payments under the Term Loan Facility.\n\nIn the event of an event of default under the Term Loan Facility, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the Term Loan Facility and foreclose on the collateral securing the Term Loan Facility. The collateral securing the Term Loan Facility includes substantially all of the Company's assets, including its property, plant, and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and intellectual property. The Company's failure to comply with the covenants under the Term Loan Facility could result in the loss of its assets and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company's management team is working to mitigate the risks associated with the Term Loan Facility.

This settlement was reached after an audit of the Company's tax returns for the years 2018 through 2020. The settlement resulted in a reduction of tax reserves of $11.3 million, which was recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 24.1%, compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the recognition of discrete tax benefits of $11.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the settlement of a tax audit and the release of a valuation allowance of $3.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe valuation allowance release of $3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the Company's reassessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized, resulting in the release of the valuation allowance. This release was recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 23.6%, compared to 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance of $11.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2021, which was offset by the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $11.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the settlement of a tax audit.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state tax reserves of $16.1 million, $5.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which represent the Company's estimate of the liability for uncertain tax positions. These reserves are based on the Company's assessment of the likelihood of sustaining its tax positions, taking into account the technical merits of the positions, the applicable tax laws and regulations, and the potential settlement or litigation outcomes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state tax reserves of $16.1 million, $5.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The slight increase in state tax reserves from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was due to changes in state tax laws and regulations, which resulted in an increase in the Company's estimated liability for uncertain tax positions.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $2.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $2.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods based on various factors, including changes in tax laws and regulations, the outcome of tax audits and settlements, and the realization of deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to monitor these factors and adjust its tax reserves and valuation allowances accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the tax reserves and valuation allowances discussed above, the Company also has deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $23.4 million, compared to net deferred tax assets of $20.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in net deferred tax assets was primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets related to the settlement of a tax audit and the release of a valuation allowance.\n\nThe Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company does not expect to realize the majority of its deferred tax assets within the next 12 months, and therefore, has classified them as non-current.\n\nIn conclusion, the Company's effective tax rate for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 was influenced by various factors, including the recognition of discrete tax benefits and the release of valuation allowances. The Company will continue to monitor its tax positions and adjust its tax reserves and valuation allowances accordingly. output: \u2019s effective tax rate, the tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was 25.2%, compared to 24.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties in income tax expense and the related tax benefit in the provision for income taxes.\n\nThe evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The second step is to measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions at each reporting period and adjusts the unrecognized tax benefit accordingly.\n\nThe Company has not recognized any tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements related to any tax loss carryforwards that are subject to the 80% limitation of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).

The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year based on these factors.\n\nIn 2023, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $14.1 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 25.6%. The effective tax rate for 2023 is higher than the statutory tax rate due to the impact of state taxes and the limitation on the deductibility of certain expenses.\n\nThe Company's tax policy is to comply with all applicable tax laws and regulations and to take advantage of available tax credits and deductions.

The Term Loan Facility will have a maturity date of March 15, 2028 and will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) 3.25% and (b) the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR or SOFR Rate (as defined in the Agreement) plus (ii) 2.25% (subject to a 1.00% floor), plus (iii) the applicable margin.\n\nThe Term Loan Facility will be subject to certain conditions precedent to closing, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent to closing, such as the execution of definitive documentation, the delivery of customary closing documents, and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Specifically, the Company must deliver to the Lenders certain documents, including, but not limited to, a certificate of the Company's secretary certifying the resolutions adopted by the Company's board of directors authorizing the execution, delivery, and performance of the Agreement, as well as a certificate of the Company's chief financial officer certifying that the Company has complied with the conditions precedent to closing set forth in the Agreement.\n\nThe Company intends to use the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility to repay a portion of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt under its existing credit facilities, including the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and the Company\u2019s term loan B, and for general corporate purposes. The repayment of the Company's outstanding debt will allow the Company to reduce its overall debt burden and free up additional liquidity for future business opportunities.\n\nThe Term Loan Facility contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00, a leverage ratio of 5.50 to 1.00 and a total net leverage ratio of 5.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly, subject to certain exceptions. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the Company's consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Agreement) by its consolidated fixed charges (as defined in the Agreement), and the leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio are calculated by dividing the Company's consolidated total debt (as defined in the Agreement) by its consolidated EBITDA. The Company is required to deliver to the Lenders quarterly compliance certificates, which must be certified by the Company's chief financial officer, confirming that the Company has complied with these covenants.\n\nThe Term Loan Facility also contains certain events of default, including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal, interest or fees, breach of covenants, and certain other events of default, such as a change of control of the Company, a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operations, or financial condition, and the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. In the event of a default, the Lenders may accelerate the Term Loan Facility, which would require the Company to immediately repay all outstanding principal, interest, and fees under the Term Loan Facility.\n\nThe Company has also agreed to pay certain fees in connection with the Term Loan Facility, including, but not limited to, a commitment fee, a funding fee, and an administrative agent fee. The commitment fee is equal to 0.50% per annum of the unused portion of the Term Loan Facility, the funding fee is equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, and the administrative agent fee is equal to $50,000 per annum.\n\nThe foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nAs part of the Agreement, the Company has also entered into a security agreement (the \"Security Agreement\") with the Lenders, pursuant to which the Company has granted a lien on certain of its assets, including, but not limited to, its accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The Security Agreement requires the Company to maintain certain insurance coverage with respect to its assets and to comply with certain other obligations.\n\nIn addition, the Company has entered into an intercreditor agreement (the \"Intercreditor Agreement\") with the Lenders and certain other creditors of the Company, which governs the relative rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the Term Loan Facility and certain other debt obligations of the Company. The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the subordination of certain of the Company's debt obligations to the Term Loan Facility and establishes certain procedures for the distribution of proceeds in the event of a default under the Term Loan Facility.\n\nThe Company believes that the Term Loan Facility will provide it with the necessary liquidity to execute its business strategy and meet its financial obligations. The Company's management has carefully considered the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Facility and believes that they are reasonable and customary for a facility of this type.\n\nBy entering into the Agreement, the Company is able to refinance a significant portion of its outstanding debt on more favorable terms, which is expected to result in significant interest savings over the life of the Term Loan Facility. The Company's management believes that the refinancing of its debt will have a positive impact on its financial condition and results of operations, and will provide the Company with greater flexibility to pursue future business opportunities.\n\nIn connection with the Term Loan Facility, the Company has engaged in certain related transactions, including, but not limited to, the repayment of certain outstanding debt obligations and the termination of certain existing credit facilities. These transactions are expected to result in significant cost savings and will simplify the Company's capital structure. output: EXHIBIT 99.1\n\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with affiliates of funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and its affiliates (collectively, \u201cOaktree\u201d) and certain other third-party lenders (collectively, the \u201cLenders\u201d) to provide for a new term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nOur primary exposure to market risk is due to our cash, cash equivalents, investments, and derivative instruments. We have not entered into any derivatives that are not hedged. As of December 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were primarily in U.S. dollars, with the majority held at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or other similar insurance entities. These institutions are highly rated and have a strong track record of stability, which helps to minimize our exposure to credit risk.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were primarily held in accounts that were not subject to any restrictions on withdrawals. This allows us to access our funds quickly and efficiently, should we need to do so. Our investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate risk. As interest rates fluctuate, the value of our investments may also change. However, we have a diversified investment portfolio that is designed to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio consisted of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income securities, primarily consisting of U.S. government securities, corporate debt securities, and commercial paper. U.S. government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are considered to be very low risk. Corporate debt securities and commercial paper are subject to a higher level of credit risk, but we only invest in highly rated issuers to minimize this risk.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our investment portfolio was $2.4 billion. This represents a significant portion of our overall assets and is an important component of our financial condition. We may also be exposed to market risk from our derivative instruments. However, as of December 31, 2023, we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments.\n\nOur investments are subject to market risk from interest rate changes, and our cash, cash equivalents, and investments are subject to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes. However, as of December 31, 2023, we had no foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, which minimizes our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We have not entered into any derivative instruments that are not hedged, and we have not entered into any hedging transactions for interest rate risk.\n\nWe may enter into hedging transactions in the future, should we determine that it is necessary to manage our exposure to market risk. We use various financial instruments to manage our exposure to market risk, including cash, cash equivalents, and investments. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes, as this is not a key component of our business strategy. We do not believe that the use of financial instruments for trading purposes would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $2.4 billion. We consider our cash, cash equivalents, and investments to be available to meet our operating needs. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments are not subject to any restrictions on use and are liquid. This provides us with the flexibility to use our funds as needed to support our business operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. This means that we are not subject to any debt covenants or restrictions that could limit our ability to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n[Insert table]\n\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments are sufficient to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. However, we may need to access additional funding sources in the future, should our business operations require it. We have a number of options available to us, including borrowing under our credit facilities, issuing debt or equity securities, or entering into other financing arrangements.\n\nIn addition to our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, we also have a number of other financial instruments that are subject to market risk. These include our accounts receivable and accounts payable, which are subject to credit risk. However, we have a diversified customer base and only deal with highly rated suppliers, which helps to minimize our exposure to credit risk.\n\nWe also have a number of other financial instruments that are not subject to market risk, such as our property and equipment, which are held at cost and depreciated over their useful lives. These assets are not subject to market fluctuations and are an important component of our financial condition.\n\nOverall, we believe that our financial instruments are managed in a way that minimizes our exposure to market risk. We will continue to monitor our financial condition and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that our financial instruments are aligned with our business strategy.\n\nWe have evaluated the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our financial condition and results of operations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $20 million. Conversely, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $20 million.\n\nWe have also evaluated the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our financial condition and results of operations. However, as of December 31, 2023, we had no foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, which minimizes our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that our financial instruments are managed in a way that minimizes our exposure to market risk. We will continue to monitor our financial condition and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that our financial instruments are aligned with our business strategy. output: Item 7A.

The ongoing global pandemic, coupled with unforeseen circumstances, has significantly impacted the current and future business, financial, and operational environment. This has been reflected in changes in consumer behavior and preferences, increased costs, and supply chain disruptions, which may continue to affect our business.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be more severe than we currently anticipate. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the ongoing and future impacts of the pandemic, including the impact on our employees. Remote work arrangements and reduced staffing levels have been implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, these measures have resulted in increased operational costs, decreased productivity, and potential long-term effects on employee morale.\n\nFurthermore, the pandemic has significantly impacted our suppliers and the global supply chain. The availability of our products has been affected due to increased demand for certain products, which has resulted in production and distribution challenges. Our ability to manufacture and deliver products has been impacted by the pandemic, particularly in regions with severe outbreaks. We have experienced difficulties in maintaining our production and distribution levels, which has resulted in delays and increased costs.\n\nThe pandemic has also affected our ability to manage our costs and expenses. Remote work arrangements and reduced staffing levels have resulted in increased operational costs, including costs associated with implementing and maintaining remote work arrangements. Additionally, the pandemic has resulted in increased costs associated with maintaining a safe working environment for our employees, including costs associated with personal protective equipment, sanitization, and social distancing measures.\n\nWe are also subject to various risks related to the global economy, including the impact of inflation, interest rates, and the availability of credit. The potential for a recession or a decline in the global economy could result in a decline in demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nA recession or decline in the global economy could also impact our ability to access capital markets, which could limit our ability to refinance our debt or raise capital to fund our operations. Additionally, a recession or decline in the global economy could result in a decrease in the value of our assets, including our inventory, property, plant, and equipment, which could result in impairment charges and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nInflation could also have a significant impact on our business, particularly if we are unable to pass on increased costs to our customers. Increased costs associated with inflation could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nInterest rates also pose a significant risk to our business. Changes in interest rates could impact our ability to access capital markets and increase our borrowing costs, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, changes in interest rates could impact the value of our investments and pension obligations, which could result in gains or losses and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe availability of credit also poses a significant risk to our business. A decrease in the availability of credit could limit our ability to access capital markets, which could negatively impact our ability to refinance our debt or raise capital to fund our operations. Additionally, a decrease in the availability of credit could result in a decrease in demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIn conclusion, our operations, financial condition, and results of operations are susceptible to various risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, interest rates, and the availability of credit.

We have implemented various measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business, including implementing remote work arrangements for a significant portion of our workforce. This has enabled us to maintain business continuity and minimize disruptions to our operations. Additionally, we have implemented various cost reduction measures, such as reducing non-essential travel, renegotiating contracts with vendors, and implementing energy-efficient practices in our facilities. We have also implemented measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, including providing personal protective equipment, enhancing cleaning and sanitization protocols, and offering mental health support services.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also had an impact on the broader economy and the financial markets, including on the credit markets, interest rates, and commodity prices, which has impacted our financial results. The pandemic has led to increased volatility in the financial markets, which has affected our ability to access capital and has increased the cost of borrowing. Furthermore, the pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, leading to shortages and price increases for certain raw materials and components used in our products.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the broader economy and are actively considering the impact of the pandemic on our future financial results. We are working to mitigate the effects of the pandemic by diversifying our supply chain, investing in digital technologies to enhance our remote work capabilities, and developing contingency plans to address potential future disruptions.\n\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, changes in global economic conditions, changes in interest rates and other financial market conditions, the impact of inflation and other economic factors, changes in commodity prices, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in tax laws and regulations, changes in laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to the use of certain chemicals, changes in the competitive environment, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in the level of demand for our products, changes in the level of demand for our products in the markets in which we operate, changes in the cost of raw materials, changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products, changes in the cost of labor, changes in the cost of transportation, changes in the cost of insurance, and changes in the cost of other expenses.\n\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created significant uncertainty and volatility in the global economy. The conflict has led to disruptions in the supply of certain raw materials and components, as well as increased costs and reduced availability of transportation and logistics services. We are closely monitoring the situation and are working to mitigate the effects of the conflict on our business.\n\nChanges in global economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and other financial market conditions, could also have a significant impact on our business. Increases in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our ability to access capital, while decreases in interest rates could reduce our returns on investments. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and tax laws and regulations could also impact our financial results.\n\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to the use of certain chemicals in our products. Changes in these laws and regulations could require us to reformulate our products or to incur additional costs to comply with new requirements. Furthermore, changes in the competitive environment, including the introduction of new products or technologies by our competitors, could impact our market share and financial results.\n\nIn order to mitigate these risks, we are working to diversify our product offerings and to invest in research and development to stay ahead of the competition. We are also working to improve our operational efficiency and to reduce our costs, while maintaining our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, we are taking a proactive approach to managing the risks and uncertainties that could impact our business, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and changes in global economic conditions. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and to adapt our strategies as necessary to ensure the long-term success of our business.\n\nIn terms of our financial results, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine to continue to have a significant impact on our business in the near term. We anticipate that our revenue and profitability will be affected by the ongoing disruptions to our supply chain and the increased costs associated with the pandemic and the conflict. However, we are working to mitigate these effects and to position our business for long-term success.\n\nOur cost of goods sold has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, primarily due to increased costs for raw materials, labor, and transportation. We have implemented various cost reduction measures to mitigate these effects, including renegotiating contracts with vendors and implementing energy-efficient practices in our facilities.\n\nOur operating expenses have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, primarily due to increased costs for remote work arrangements, personal protective equipment, and other expenses related to the pandemic. We have implemented various measures to reduce our operating expenses, including reducing non-essential travel and investing in digital technologies to enhance our remote work capabilities.\n\nIn terms of our liquidity and capital resources, we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable future.

The agreement was the result of negotiations between the Company and the holders of the Convertible Notes, which began in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company's management and Board of Directors determined that settling the conversion rights was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, as it eliminates the potential dilutive effect of the conversion of the Convertible Notes.\n\nThe Company announced that the holders of the Convertible Notes have agreed to waive their right to convert the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. This waiver will prevent any potential dilution to the Company's existing shareholders. In connection with the agreement, the Company will make a cash payment to the holders of the Convertible Notes in an amount equal to the value of the conversion premium and accrued interest through the maturity date of the Convertible Notes.

(\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides for Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with the Company surviving the Merger. The Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the approval of the merger by the Company\u2019s shareholders and the receipt of required regulatory approvals.\n\nThe Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including a non-solicitation covenant. The non-solicitation covenant restricts the Company from soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions that allow the Company to consider and engage in discussions with respect to certain unsolicited alternative acquisition proposals that the Company\u2019s Board of Directors determines are, or are reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Merger Agreement also includes a termination fee payable by the Company in certain circumstances, including if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain the required shareholder approval and a competing acquisition proposal is consummated within a certain period.\n\nThe Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger. The Company has not yet filed the proxy statement and related proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) in connection with the solicitation of shareholder approval of the Merger. The Company expects to file the proxy statement and related proxy materials with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Gurnet Point has agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock for a cash purchase price of $X per share. The total consideration to be paid by Gurnet Point in connection with the Merger is estimated to be approximately $Y million, based on the number of outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the Company\u2019s net working capital, cash, and indebtedness at the time of closing.\n\nThe Merger Agreement also includes provisions for the treatment of outstanding equity awards granted under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans. Under these provisions, outstanding options to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the excess of the purchase price over the exercise price of the option, and outstanding restricted stock units will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the purchase price.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and has recommended that the Company\u2019s shareholders approve the Merger. The approval of the Merger by the Company\u2019s shareholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.\n\nItem 5.03\n\nAmendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the \u201cAmendment\u201d), which was approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The Amendment, which was approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors in connection with the Merger, eliminates the Company\u2019s staggered board of directors and provides that the Company\u2019s Board of Directors will be divided into three classes with staggered terms, with each class serving for a term of three years, subject to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and the Company\u2019s bylaws.\n\nThe Amendment also eliminates the Company\u2019s supermajority provision for merger and other corporate actions. Prior to the Amendment, the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation required the approval of at least two-thirds of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock to approve certain corporate actions, including mergers and acquisitions. The Amendment reduces this threshold to a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock, which is consistent with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n\nThe Amendment will become effective in connection with the closing of the Merger. At that time, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors will be reconstituted to consist of three classes of directors, with the members of each class serving for a term of three years. The directors who will comprise the reconstituted Board of Directors have been designated by Gurnet Point, and will include a combination of existing members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and new directors designated by Gurnet Point.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors has determined that the Amendment is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and has recommended that the Company\u2019s shareholders approve the Merger, which includes the adoption of the Amendment. The approval of the Amendment is a condition to the closing of the Merger, and is expected to occur concurrently with the approval of the Merger by the Company\u2019s shareholders. output: Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Gurnet Point Capital (\u201cGurnet Point\u201d) and its subsidiary, Gurnet Point Capital Merger Subsidiary, Inc.

These disruptions have caused and may continue to cause significant fluctuations in the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. For example, the pandemic has led to widespread lockdowns, social distancing measures, and travel restrictions, which have reduced consumer spending and led to a decline in demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be impacted by the Company\u2019s inability to obtain supplies and materials, including the Company\u2019s inability to obtain supplies and materials in a timely and cost-effective manner, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.

The Company may not be able to anticipate or respond to these changes in a timely and effective manner, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Company faces a range of risks and uncertainties that could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s management is taking various steps to mitigate these risks and uncertainties, but the Company may not be able to fully mitigate their impact.

This information is provided in the tables below.\n\n| Production Costs | Cost of Sales | Selling, General and Administrative Expenses |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Labor | $1,000,000 | $500,000 | $200,000 |\n| Overhead | $500,000 | $200,000 | $100,000 |\n| Materials | $200,000 | $100,000 | $50,000 |\n| Other | $100,000 | $50,000 | $25,000 |\n\nThe Company's policy is to capitalize all costs related to the production of products and services, including labor and overhead, and to expense such costs as they are incurred. The Company believes that this approach provides a more accurate representation of its financial position and performance, and is consistent with accounting standards and regulatory requirements.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Company expenses the costs of advertising and marketing campaigns when incurred. These costs are recorded as expenses on the income statement, rather than being capitalized as assets. The Company believes that this approach is consistent with the nature of these expenses, which are typically incurred in the short-term and do not provide long-term benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, the Company's policy is to capitalize all costs related to the production of products and services, including labor and overhead, and to expense such costs as they are incurred. The Company believes that this approach provides a more accurate representation of its financial position and performance, and is consistent with accounting standards and regulatory requirements. output: Excerpt (Expanded):\n\nThe Company's capitalization policy is applied consistently across all product and service categories.

We adjust the valuation allowance as necessary based on changes in facts and circumstances, including changes in operating results. As of December 31, 2022, our valuation allowance was $X, which represents a decrease of $Y from the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the improvement in our operating results and the increase in our forecasted future taxable income.\n\n\u2022Deferred tax expense or benefit.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $B of unrecognized tax benefits, which represents the amount of tax benefits that we have claimed on our tax returns but have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. We believe that it is more likely than not that these tax benefits will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority.\n\nWe also have $C of accrued interest and penalties related to our uncertain tax positions, which is included in our income tax expense. We record interest and penalties related to tax positions in income tax expense, and we adjust our estimates as necessary based on changes in facts and circumstances, including changes in operating results and the outcome of examinations.\n\nIn 2022, we settled several tax audits with the relevant taxing authorities, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $D. We also received a tax refund of $E related to a prior year tax return. These amounts were recognized in our financial statements as a reduction to our income tax expense.\n\nWe will continue to monitor our tax positions and adjust our estimates as necessary based on changes in facts and circumstances, including changes in operating results, tax laws, and the outcome of examinations. We believe that our tax positions are reasonable and are supported by the technical merits of the positions. However, if the relevant taxing authority were to disagree with our assessment, we may be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. output: ...and 2022, we did not recognize a tax benefit for these amounts as the related tax positions are uncertain.

The Company may also use other methods to repurchase shares under the program, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans, which would allow the Company to repurchase shares at predetermined times and prices.\n\nThe Company has no current plans to repurchase shares under the program. However, the Company may begin repurchasing shares at any time and may do so in a manner that is designed to minimize the impact on the market price of the Company's common stock.

The Company repurchased approximately $750 million of its common stock under the previous program. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized the new share repurchase program as a means to return value to the Company's shareholders and to offset the dilutive effect of employee stock option and equity award grants.\n\nThe Company's ability to repurchase shares under the program may be limited by a number of factors, including the Company's ability to generate cash from operations, the terms of the Company's credit facility, and the Company's compliance with applicable law and regulations. The Company's credit facility contains certain restrictions on the Company's ability to repurchase shares, including a requirement that the Company maintain a minimum level of consolidated net worth.\n\nThe Company's management will continue to evaluate the Company's capital allocation priorities and will consider a variety of factors, including the Company's business and financial performance, its cash balances, and general market conditions, when determining whether to repurchase shares under the program. The Company will also consider the potential impact of any share repurchases on its credit ratings and its ability to access the capital markets.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors has delegated to the Company's management the authority to determine the timing and amount of any share repurchases under the program, subject to certain limitations and guidelines. The Company's management will report to the Board of Directors on a regular basis regarding the Company's repurchase activity under the program.\n\nAs of the date of this filing, the Company has not repurchased any shares under the new share repurchase program.

We believe that the following policies are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 1, \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our accounting policies.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $5.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and $4.6 billion of debt. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months, including funding our expected cash requirements for capital expenditures, debt repayment, and other obligations. See Note 5, \u201cDebt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our debt and Note 8, \u201cInvestments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our investments.\n\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are primarily held in the United States, with a small portion held in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our foreign-held cash is denominated in U.S. dollars or other major currencies and can be repatriated to the United States without significant restrictions. However, we do have some cash and investments held in countries with currency controls or other restrictions that may limit our ability to access these funds in the short term.\n\nIn addition to the matters discussed in Note 1, \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, we believe the following are material factors that could impact our liquidity:\n\n\u2022 Capital expenditures: We expect to continue to invest in new and existing products, technologies, and infrastructure, including investments in our digital transformation initiatives, to support our growth strategy. Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be around $1.4 billion, which includes investments in new and existing products, technologies, and infrastructure, as well as investments in our digital transformation initiatives. The majority of these expenditures will be focused on expanding our digital capabilities, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing customer experience. We expect to fund these expenditures primarily through cash generated from operations.\n\n\u2022 Debt repayment: We expect to repay debt through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our debt repayment plan is expected to be around $1.4 billion for 2024. We have a mix of short-term and long-term debt with varying interest rates and maturity dates. Our debt repayment plan is designed to manage our debt levels and reduce our interest expense over time.\n\n\u2022 Dividend payments: We have a history of paying quarterly dividends. The amount of our quarterly dividend is determined by our Board of Directors, which considers our earnings, cash flow, and other factors in making such determination. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in 2024, but the amount and timing of these dividends will depend on our financial performance and other factors.\n\n\u2022 Discretionary spending: We may need to reduce discretionary spending to maintain our financial flexibility if our cash flows are impacted by any factors, including changes in the level of our capital expenditures, changes in our business environment, or changes in our financial performance. Discretionary spending includes items such as marketing and advertising expenses, research and development expenses, and other non-essential operating expenses. We have a flexible budgeting process that allows us to adjust our discretionary spending in response to changes in our business or financial performance.\n\n\u2022 Interest rates: Interest rates could increase, which could increase our interest expense and reduce our ability to make debt repayments. We have a mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, which helps to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on our interest expense. However, if interest rates were to increase significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\n\n\u2022 Economic conditions: Economic conditions could deteriorate, which could negatively impact our business and cash flows. We operate in a number of industries and geographies, which helps to diversify our revenue streams and reduce our exposure to economic downturns in any one area. However, if there were a broad-based economic downturn, it could have a material impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\n\n\u2022 Regulatory actions: Regulatory actions could impact our business and cash flows. We are subject to a number of regulations and laws in the countries where we operate, and changes in these regulations or laws could require us to make significant investments or changes to our business. We have a robust compliance program in place to help us manage regulatory risks, but if there were a significant change in regulations or laws, it could have a material impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\n\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, combined with our expected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months. However, we will continue to monitor our liquidity and adjust our plans as needed to ensure that we have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations and invest in our business.\n\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, we also have a number of other liquidity management strategies in place, including:\n\n\u2022 Cash pooling: We have a cash pooling arrangement in place that allows us to manage our cash and cash equivalents across our global operations.

This represents a year-over-year increase of $700,000 in accounts receivable and $250,000 in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The growth in accounts receivable is primarily due to increased sales and an expanded customer base.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any trends or events that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to collect its accounts receivable. However, the Company continuously monitors economic conditions, industry trends, and customer financial health to assess potential risks. Based on this analysis, the Company has determined that its accounts receivable balance remains collectible.\n\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\u2019s best estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that may become uncollectible based on historical experience and the Company\u2019s current experience. The Company periodically reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjusts it based on the Company\u2019s current experience, including the Company\u2019s historical experience and the Company\u2019s current experience. This review process involves analyzing various factors, including customer payment history, industry trends, and general economic conditions.\n\nThe Company has not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts in 2022, 2021, and 2020, as the Company believes the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2022 and 2021, is fully collectible. However, the Company did record an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,000 in 2020, as the Company believed that a specific account receivable was unlikely to be collected. This allowance was established based on management\u2019s assessment of the customer\u2019s financial condition and payment history.\n\nThe Company\u2019s accounts receivable are generally collected within 60 days of the invoice date. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company had no accounts receivable that were past due more than 90 days. The Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\n\nThe Company has a diverse customer base, with no single customer accounting for more than 10% of total accounts receivable. This diversity helps to minimize the risk of uncollectible accounts and supports the Company\u2019s assessment that its accounts receivable balance is fully collectible.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company also maintains a reserve for returns and refunds. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, this reserve was $150,000 and $100,000, respectively.

Output as [CATEGORIES] | SUMMARY input: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\n\nAs discussed above, the Company's cash flow is a critical component of its financial health, and management regularly monitors and assesses the Company's liquidity position to ensure that it has sufficient resources to meet its financial obligations. The Company has no material obligations that mature in less than one year, except for normal trade payables, accrued expenses, and other liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. These liabilities are typically settled within a short period, usually 30 to 90 days, and are not considered a significant strain on the Company's liquidity.\n\nThe Company's $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which expires in March 2027, provides an essential source of liquidity to support its operations and strategic initiatives. The revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a leverage ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a total net worth covenant, which are designed to ensure that the Company maintains a prudent level of debt and maintains its financial health. The Company is in compliance with these covenants and regularly reviews its financial position to ensure that it remains in compliance.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the revolving credit agreement contains a springing maturity provision that requires repayment of outstanding borrowings if the Company's consolidated total net worth falls below $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's consolidated total net worth exceeded $5.0 billion, providing a comfortable cushion against this provision.\n\nThe Company had $0.3 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2022, and $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity. This provides the Company with significant flexibility to respond to changing business conditions and capitalize on strategic opportunities. In addition to the revolving credit agreement, the Company also has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit agreement. Although the Company has not borrowed under the commercial paper program, it provides an additional source of liquidity and increases the Company's overall borrowing capacity.\n\nThe commercial paper securitization program is another essential component of the Company's liquidity management strategy. This program allows the Company to issue commercial paper notes to investors in exchange for cash collateral, which is backed by the revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper notes and had $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under the commercial paper securitization program.\n\nIn addition to its borrowing capacity, the Company also manages its exposure to foreign currencies through various foreign currency exchange agreements. These agreements are not designated as hedging instruments and are not effective hedges for accounting purposes. However, they help to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company's financial results.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a notional value of $1.2 billion. These contracts are used to manage the Company's exposure to certain foreign currencies and are not designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe Company has also entered into foreign currency option contracts to manage its exposure to certain foreign currencies. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, and the fair value of these contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company regularly assesses the effectiveness of these hedges and adjusts its hedging strategy as necessary to ensure that it remains aligned with its risk management objectives.\n\nIn summary, the Company's liquidity position is strong, with significant borrowing capacity and a diverse range of liquidity sources. The Company's management regularly monitors and assesses its liquidity position to ensure that it has sufficient resources to meet its financial obligations and capitalize on strategic opportunities.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company's liquidity position as of December 31, 2022:\n\n|  | Amount (in billions) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Revolving credit agreement | $1.0 |\n| Outstanding borrowings under revolving credit agreement | $0.3 |\n| Available borrowing capacity under revolving credit agreement | $1.0 |\n| Commercial paper program | $1.0 |\n| Available borrowing capacity under commercial paper program | $1.0 |\n| Commercial paper securitization program | $1.0 |\n| Available borrowing capacity under commercial paper securitization program | $1.0 |\n| Foreign currency forward contracts | $1.2 |\n\nThe Company's liquidity position is expected to remain strong in the coming year, with significant borrowing capacity and a diverse range of liquidity sources. However, the Company's management will continue to monitor and assess its liquidity position to ensure that it remains aligned with its risk management objectives and strategic initiatives. output: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company's liquidity position as of December 31, 2022:\n\n|  | Amount (in billions) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Revolving credit agreement | $1.0 |\n| Outstanding borrowings under revolving credit agreement | $0.3 |\n| Available borrowing capacity under revolving credit agreement | $1.0 |\n| Commercial paper program | $1.0 |\n| Available borrowing capacity under commercial paper program | $1.0 |\n| Commercial paper securitization program | $1.0 |\n| Available borrowing capacity under commercial paper securitization program | $1.0 |\n| Foreign currency forward"

Our business is subject to risks related to global political and economic instability. For example, if the U.S. government imposes sanctions on a particular country, our business in that country may be negatively impacted. Similarly, if there is an escalation in the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, our business in China may be negatively impacted. Additionally, global events such as wars, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters can also impact our business operations and the demand for our products and services. Furthermore, changes in government policies and regulations can also impact our business operations and profitability.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our business operations are conducted in various countries and we have transactions in multiple currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, and renminbi. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates can impact our revenues, costs, and profitability. For example, if the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro, our revenues from European operations may decrease, which could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to changes in laws and regulations. Our business operations are subject to various laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, including laws related to employment, taxes, and the environment. Changes in these laws and regulations can impact our business operations and profitability. For example, if a new law is enacted that increases our costs of doing business, we may need to adjust our pricing strategy, which could negatively impact our business. Similarly, if a new regulation is enacted that requires us to change our business practices, we may need to incur additional costs to comply with the regulation, which could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to cybersecurity and data breaches. Our business operations rely heavily on information technology systems and we store sensitive data, including customer information and intellectual property. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with cybersecurity and data breaches. If our systems are hacked or our data is breached, we may incur significant costs to repair our systems and notify affected parties, which could negatively impact our business. Additionally, a data breach could also damage our reputation and lead to a loss of customer trust, which could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to intellectual property protection. Our business operations rely heavily on intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with intellectual property protection. If our intellectual property is infringed or misappropriated, we may incur significant costs to enforce our rights, which could negatively impact our business. Additionally, if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may be able to develop similar products and services, which could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to supply chain disruptions. Our business operations rely heavily on our supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics providers. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with supply chain disruptions. If our suppliers are unable to deliver raw materials or components on time, we may be unable to meet customer demand, which could negatively impact our business. Similarly, if our manufacturers are unable to produce our products on time, we may be unable to meet customer demand, which could negatively impact our business.\n\nIn addition to these risks, we are also subject to risks related to the concentration of our customer base. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of customers. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with the concentration of our customer base. If one or more of our major customers experiences financial difficulties or reduces their purchases of our products and services, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to the concentration of our supplier base. A significant portion of our raw materials and components is sourced from a limited number of suppliers. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with the concentration of our supplier base. If one or more of our major suppliers experiences financial difficulties or is unable to deliver raw materials or components on time, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to the impact of climate change. Climate change is a global issue that is expected to have significant impacts on the environment, economies, and societies. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with the impact of climate change. If climate change leads to increased regulatory requirements or changes in customer behavior, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, we have implemented various risk management strategies, including diversification of our customer and supplier base, development of contingency plans for supply chain disruptions, and implementation of cybersecurity measures to protect our systems and data. Additionally, we regularly review and update our risk management strategies to ensure that they are effective and aligned with our business operations.\n\nDespite these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate all of the risks associated with our business operations. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\nIn conclusion, our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we have implemented various risk management strategies to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate all of the risks associated with our business operations. As a result, investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our company. output: ...to global political and economic instability.

These securities are included in the \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d line item in our consolidated balance sheet. The short-term investments are valued at fair value, which is determined based on market quotations. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our short-term investments in available-for-sale securities was $1,000, and the gross unrealized loss was $0. There were no short-term investments in held-to-maturity securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $150,000 of long-term debt due within one year, which represents the first payment of our 2025 Senior Notes. The remaining long-term debt is due in installments over the next 4 years. We expect to fund our long-term debt obligations with cash and/or proceeds from our available-for-sale securities. We expect to refinance our long-term debt obligations at maturity with a combination of cash and/or debt issuance. We have a proven track record of accessing the debt markets and believe that we will be able to refinance our debt obligations on favorable terms.\n\nWe have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. The interest rate swap agreements have a notional value of $1,000,000 and a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.2%.

The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was $5,000 as of December 31, 2023, and is included in the \u201cOther assets\u201d line item in our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, combined with our expected cash flows from operations and our access to the debt markets, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months. We continuously monitor our liquidity and capital resources and may adjust our plans as necessary to ensure that we have sufficient resources to meet our obligations.\n\nIn addition to our contractual obligations, we have other commitments and contingencies that may affect our liquidity and cash flows. These commitments and contingencies include lease agreements, purchase commitments, and litigation and regulatory matters. We believe that these commitments and contingencies will not have a material impact on our liquidity and cash flows.\n\nWe have a $500,000 revolving credit facility that expires in 2026. The revolving credit facility is collateralized by our assets and has a weighted average interest rate of 2.8%. We have not drawn on the revolving credit facility and do not anticipate drawing on it in the near future.\n\nWe have a strong track record of managing our liquidity and capital resources.

The loss on the sale of a portion of our interest in a joint venture is included in the Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates line item on our consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe joint venture sales were a result of our ongoing portfolio management efforts to optimize our investments and focus on core business opportunities. The gain was generated from the sale of a 20% stake in a joint venture that was established to develop and operate a large-scale project. The sale was completed on June 30, 2022, and the proceeds were received in the third quarter of 2022. The loss, on the other hand, was incurred from the sale of a 15% stake in another joint venture that was established to develop and market a new technology.

The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to an increase in net income and an increase in non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable and other current assets. The increase in net income was driven by improved operating performance across our business segments, particularly in our core operations. The increase in non-cash items was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to new asset additions and investments.\n\nThe decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to improved payment terms with our suppliers and the settlement of certain outstanding liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable and other current assets was driven by higher sales volumes and the timing of customer payments.\n\nWe generated $1.5 billion of cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cash from investing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets and a decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The increase in proceeds from the sale of assets was driven by the joint venture sales mentioned earlier, as well as the sale of certain non-core assets. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to the completion of several large-scale projects and the deferral of certain capital spending plans.\n\nThe increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates was driven by our strategic investments in several joint ventures and partnerships to support our growth initiatives and expand our market presence.\n\nWe used $1.1 billion of cash for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases and an increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and an increase in dividends paid to our shareholders.\n\nThe decrease in share repurchases was due to our decision to prioritize debt repayment and invest in growth initiatives. The increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility was driven by our need to fund working capital requirements and support our growth initiatives. The decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt was due to our decision to rely on our revolving credit facility for financing needs.\n\nThe increase in dividends paid to our shareholders was driven by our commitment to return value to our shareholders and our confidence in our financial performance.\n\nOur revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of long-term debt, refinancing of our long-term debt, funding of our capital expenditures, funding of our working capital requirements, and funding of our acquisitions. The revolving credit facility matures on March 15, 2027. The revolving credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain a minimum ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense, a minimum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and a minimum ratio of total equity to total debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility. We believe that our revolving credit facility provides us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn addition to our revolving credit facility, we have a robust cash management system in place to manage our liquidity and funding requirements. We continuously monitor our cash flows and adjust our funding plans as needed to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations.\n\nWe believe that our strong financial performance, combined with our solid liquidity position, provides us with a solid foundation to execute our business strategy and drive long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.\" output: \", and a $1.1 billion gain on the sale of a portion of our interest in a joint venture, partially offset by a $1.1 billion loss on the sale of a portion of our interest in a joint venture.

The events of default include, but are not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due, breach of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with other debt instruments, and the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events.\n\nIn the event of a default, the lenders under the Credit Facilities may, among other things, accelerate the maturity of the debt, increase the interest rates applicable to the debt, and exercise their rights as secured creditors with respect to the collateral. The Company is also required to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Facilities, including commitment fees, letter of credit fees, and agent fees.\n\nThe Credit Agreement has a maturity date of April 28, 2028, with respect to the Term Loan Facility and April 28, 2026, with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company's largest customer accounted for approximately 12% of the Company's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company's customer base is diverse, with no single customer accounting for more than 10% of the Company's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for the largest customer. The Company's largest customers are generally the Company's major retailers and distributors in the United States, Canada, and Europe.\n\nThe Company's customer base is comprised of a variety of retailers, including big-box stores, specialty retailers, and online marketplaces. The Company's products are sold through various channels, including in-store displays, online platforms, and direct-to-consumer sales. The Company's relationships with its customers are generally long-standing, with many customers having been with the Company for several years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company's accounts receivable were $145.2 million, of which $45.4 million was due from the Company's largest customer. This represents a decrease of $10.1 million in accounts receivable from the prior year, primarily due to the Company's efforts to improve its collections process and reduce its days sales outstanding. The Company's accounts payable were $135.2 million, of which $45.2 million was to the Company's largest customer. This represents an increase of $15.5 million in accounts payable from the prior year, primarily due to the Company's increased purchasing activity to meet growing demand for its products.\n\nThe Company's sales are subject to fluctuations due to changes in consumer demand for the Company's products, which are influenced by a variety of factors including general economic conditions, consumer spending patterns, weather, trade, and other factors beyond the Company's control. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company experienced a decline in sales of its winter-related products due to unseasonably warm weather in certain regions. Conversely, the Company experienced an increase in sales of its summer-related products due to warmer-than-expected weather in other regions.\n\nThe Company's ability to meet demand for its products may be affected by various factors, including the availability of raw materials and components, the Company's ability to timely and cost-effectively manufacture its products, the availability of shipping capacity, the Company's ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage, and the Company's ability to obtain and maintain adequate foreign trade licenses and permits. To mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented a variety of strategies, including diversifying its supplier base, investing in manufacturing efficiency initiatives, and developing relationships with multiple shipping providers.\n\nThe Company's sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer. The Company does not have any long-term contracts with its customers, and the Company does not have any significant inventory write-offs. The Company's standard payment terms are typically 30 to 60 days, although some customers may have longer or shorter payment terms depending on their specific agreements with the Company.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $15.3 million, of which $5.3 million were used to support the Company's foreign trade letters of credit. These letters of credit are used to support the Company's imports of raw materials and components from foreign suppliers. The Company also has a credit facility with a major financial institution, which provides the Company with access to additional funding if needed.\n\nThe Company is subject to certain risks related to its use of third-party logistics providers, including the risk of loss or damage to the Company's products during transportation and the risk that the Company's third-party logistics providers may not perform their obligations in accordance with the Company's requirements. To mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented a variety of strategies, including conducting regular audits of its third-party logistics providers, implementing robust inventory tracking and monitoring systems, and developing relationships with multiple logistics providers.\n\nDespite these risks, the Company has not experienced any material losses as a result of its use of third-party logistics providers. The Company's logistics providers are generally responsible for transporting the Company's products from its manufacturing facilities to its customers' warehouses or distribution centers.\n\nThe Company's financial statements do not include any amounts for the Company's joint venture. The Company's joint venture is not material to the Company's financial statements, as it does not meet the criteria for consolidation under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The Company also maintains insurance coverage and has established reserve accounts to mitigate potential losses and expenses associated with these matters.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf, including those discussed in Item 1A of this report. The following are some of the material risks that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements:\n\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its business and operations, including those related to the impact of inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and other economic and market conditions. These risks may affect the Company's ability to maintain its pricing power, manage its costs, and ensure the timely delivery of its products to customers. Additionally, the Company's dependence on a limited number of products and a limited number of customers may exacerbate these risks, as changes in demand from these customers or disruptions to the supply chain could have a disproportionate impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on a limited number of products, including the impact of changes in demand for these products on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows, as well as the impact of the Company\u2019s reliance on these products on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its debt obligations. If demand for these products were to decline significantly, the Company may need to reduce production levels, which could result in higher costs per unit and lower profitability. Furthermore, the Company's reliance on a limited number of products may limit its ability to respond to changes in market conditions or customer preferences, which could negatively impact its competitiveness and market share.\n\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on a limited number of customers, including the impact of changes in demand from these customers on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows, as well as the impact of the Company\u2019s reliance on these customers on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its debt obligations. The loss of any of these customers or a significant reduction in their demand for the Company's products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the Company's reliance on a limited number of customers may limit its ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.\n\nIn addition to these risks, the Company is also subject to risks related to its supply chain, including the potential for disruptions, delays, or cost increases. The Company relies on a network of suppliers and manufacturers to produce and deliver its products, and any disruptions to this network could impact the Company's ability to meet customer demand and maintain its pricing power. Furthermore, the Company's supply chain may be subject to risks related to labor practices, environmental sustainability, and compliance with laws and regulations, which could negatively impact the Company's reputation and brand.\n\nThe Company is also subject to risks related to its debt obligations, including the potential for increased interest rates, debt service costs, and refinancing risks. The Company's debt obligations may limit its ability to invest in its business, pursue strategic opportunities, and respond to changes in market conditions, which could negatively impact its competitiveness and market share. Furthermore, the Company's debt obligations may subject it to risks related to debt covenants and credit ratings, which could impact its ability to access capital markets and maintain its liquidity.\n\nIn light of these risks, the Company's management and board of directors regularly review and assess the Company's risk management practices to ensure that they are adequate and effective. The Company also maintains a comprehensive risk management framework, which includes policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate and manage risks. Additionally, the Company regularly monitors and assesses its business and operations to identify potential risks and opportunities, and takes steps to address them in a timely and effective manner.\" output: \", the Company\u2019s board of directors has approved the Company\u2019s 2023 annual cash dividend.

The Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, but this growth has been accompanied by rising inflation, increasing labor costs, and a highly competitive business environment. These factors can affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its pricing power, manage its costs, and achieve its sales and revenue targets in China. Furthermore, the Chinese government has implemented various policies to regulate the economy, including policies related to foreign investment, currency exchange, and trade. These policies can impact the Company\u2019s business operations in China and its ability to repatriate earnings from its Chinese subsidiaries. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position are affected by the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The Company\u2019s primary foreign currency exposures are related to the RMB, the euro, and the Japanese yen. The Company\u2019s sales and purchases are typically denominated in the local currency of the country in which the transaction takes place, which can create currency exchange risks. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, these hedges may not be effective in offsetting the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the Company\u2019s financial results. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has a significant presence in the United States and other countries outside of China, and therefore, is subject to various risks and uncertainties related to the global market, including the impact of economic and political conditions on the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance, as well as the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which the Company operates. The global economy has experienced significant volatility in recent years, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, and increasing trade tensions. These factors can affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its pricing power, manage its costs, and achieve its sales and revenue targets in its international markets. Furthermore, the Company is subject to various regulatory requirements and laws in the countries in which it operates, including laws related to taxation, employment, and data protection. These laws can impact the Company\u2019s business operations and its ability to achieve its financial targets. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position are also affected by the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly for raw materials and components used in its products. The Company may enter into commodity price hedging contracts or other derivatives to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations. However, these hedges may not be effective in offsetting the impact of commodity price fluctuations on the Company\u2019s financial results. Furthermore, the Company is subject to various supply chain risks, including the risk of supplier insolvency, natural disasters, and transportation disruptions. These risks can impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the raw materials and components it needs to manufacture its products, which can affect its sales and revenue targets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position are also affected by the Company\u2019s ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies. The Company invests significant resources in research and development, and its ability to develop new products and technologies is critical to its future success. However, the development of new products and technologies is a complex and uncertain process, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its innovation efforts.\n\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position are affected by the Company\u2019s exposure to various legal and regulatory risks. The Company is subject to various laws and regulations, including laws related to product safety, employment, and data protection. These laws can impact the Company\u2019s business operations and its ability to achieve its financial targets. Furthermore, the Company is subject to various litigation risks, including product liability claims, employment disputes, and intellectual property disputes. These risks can impact the Company\u2019s financial results and its ability to achieve its business objectives.\n\nOverall, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors, including its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, commodity price fluctuations, supply chain risks, innovation risks, and legal and regulatory risks. The Company\u2019s management team closely monitors these risks and takes steps to mitigate their impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.

These increases were primarily due to the decline in our operating results, including a decline in gross profit and operating income due to lower revenues and higher costs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\n\nThe decline in gross profit was largely driven by decreased sales volumes and lower average selling prices in certain product lines, as well as higher raw material and manufacturing costs. The decline in operating income was further impacted by increased research and development expenses and higher selling, general, and administrative costs. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies, which reduced the value of our foreign-denominated revenues and earnings.\n\nCash flows provided by (used for) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, which included investments in new manufacturing facilities, equipment, and technology, as well as the sale of assets, including the divestiture of a non-core business. These increases were partially offset by higher cash paid for investments, including strategic investments in emerging technologies and partnerships.\n\nThe capital expenditures were primarily focused on enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, improving operational efficiency, and supporting the development of new products and services. We expect these investments to drive long-term growth and profitability. The sale of assets was part of our ongoing effort to optimize our portfolio and focus on core businesses.\n\nCash flows used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2.5 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher dividends paid to shareholders, reflecting our commitment to returning value to our investors, and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock, which was impacted by market conditions and our decision to prioritize share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of debt, which included the issuance of long-term bonds to refinance existing debt and support our capital structure.\n\nCash and cash equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our subsidiaries outside the United States. We have access to additional cash and cash equivalents through our credit facilities, which had a total outstanding balance of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our credit facilities are comprised of a revolving credit agreement and a term loan agreement, both of which mature in 2027. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.1 billion of outstanding commercial paper, which is used to support our short-term liquidity needs.\n\nWe expect to use cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations and make capital expenditures, and we expect to refinance our commercial paper and debt as it matures. We have a long history of generating strong cash flows from operations, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our ability to generate cash from operations is driven by our diversified business portfolio, our strong market positions, and our focus on operational efficiency.\n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. We have repurchased 15.2 million shares of our common stock under this authorization since inception, including 1.5 million shares of our common stock repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2024. We have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this authorization since December 31, 2023. We may repurchase additional shares under this authorization at any time.\n\nWe expect to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under this authorization in the future, subject to market conditions and other factors, and we may adjust the level of repurchases based on our cash flow generation, capital allocation priorities, and market opportunities. We believe that share repurchases are an effective way to return value to our shareholders and to offset the dilutive impact of share-based compensation.\n\nIn addition to share repurchases, we also prioritize dividend payments as a way to return value to our shareholders. We have a long history of paying consistent and growing dividends, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our dividend policy is subject to review and adjustment by our Board of Directors, and we may adjust our dividend payments based on our cash flow generation, capital allocation priorities, and market conditions.\n\nOverall, we believe that our strong cash flow generation, diversified business portfolio, and disciplined capital allocation strategy position us well to drive long-term growth and profitability, and to return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.\" output: \"and $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in the U.S. tax law enacted in 2022, including the reinstatement of certain tax provisions that had previously been repealed. The Company's effective income tax rate can fluctuate from year to year based on a variety of factors, including changes in tax laws and regulations, the geographic mix of its earnings, and the availability of tax credits and deductions.\n\nThe Company's tax strategy is focused on ensuring that it is in compliance with all applicable tax laws and regulations, while also seeking to minimize its tax liabilities through the use of available tax planning opportunities.

This could be due to various factors, including the failure of our third-party service providers to deliver high-quality services, inadequate internal controls, or unforeseen disruptions in our financial reporting processes. In the absence of reliable financial information, we may struggle to make informed decisions about investments, funding, and resource allocation, which could hinder our ability to drive growth, manage risks, and respond to changes in the market.\n\nWe rely on our internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements and the accuracy and completeness of our financial reporting.

These controls include procedures for financial statement preparation, account reconciliations, journal entries, and disclosure requirements. However, our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or irregularities.

Furthermore, the design of our internal controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future operating events and therefore can be based on certain assumptions that, if true, may not necessarily be indicative of future operating events.\n\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, or if we discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to conclude that our financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP, or we may be unable to timely and accurately report our financial results, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This, in turn, could lead to a decrease in our stock price, increased volatility, and reduced access to capital markets. In addition, we are required to disclose any material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIn the event of a material weakness, we would need to devote significant resources to remediation efforts, which could divert attention from other critical business activities. Remediation efforts may involve revising our control procedures, retraining personnel, and implementing new technologies, all of which would require significant investments of time, money, and personnel. We may not be able to remediate any material weakness in a timely manner, which could prolong the period of non-compliance and exacerbate the adverse effects on our business.\n\nFurthermore, our ability to remediate material weaknesses will depend on various factors, including the complexity of the issues, the availability of qualified personnel, and the effectiveness of our remediation plans. If we are unable to remediate material weaknesses in a timely and effective manner, we may be subject to regulatory actions, fines, and penalties, which could further erode investor confidence and damage our reputation.\n\nIn light of these risks, we continue to prioritize the maintenance of effective internal controls and the accuracy and reliability of our financial reporting.

The Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company has concluded that the fair value of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2023. The Company has also concluded that there was no impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company's goodwill and intangible assets primarily arose from the acquisition of its wholly-owned subsidiary. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2023, was $150.8 million and $75.2 million, respectively. The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, trademarks, and licenses. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2023, was $50.5 million.\n\nThe Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment test for goodwill involves a two-step process. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by subtracting the fair value of the reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\nThe Company has concluded that the fair value of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2023. The fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach involves estimating the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with those cash flows. The market approach involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit or asset based on comparable market transactions.\n\nThe Company has also concluded that there was no impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2023. The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no intangible assets that were being amortized. The Company's intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\n|  | Goodwill | Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Balance at January 1, 2023 | $150.8 million | $50.5 million |\n| Acquisitions | - | - |\n| Impairment losses | - | - |\n| Balance at December 31, 2023 | $150.8 million | $50.5 million |\n\nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization expense for the Company's intangible assets that were being amortized as of December 31, 2023:\n\n| Year | Estimated Amortization Expense |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2024 | $- |\n| 2025 | $- |\n| 2026 | $- |\n| 2027 | $- |\n| 2028 | $- |\n\nThe Company's intangible assets and goodwill are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in customer demand, competition, and economic conditions. The Company monitors these risks and uncertainties and updates its impairment analysis as necessary.\n\nThe Company's management has reviewed the carrying amount of its intangible assets and goodwill as of December 31, 2023, and has concluded that the carrying amount is recoverable. However, if the Company's estimates of future cash flows or other assumptions used in the impairment analysis were to change, it is possible that an impairment loss could be recognized in the future.\n\nThe Company's accounting policy for intangible assets and goodwill is to recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value. The Company's management has considered the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, and ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, in evaluating the carrying amount of its intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nThe Company's independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company's financial statements, including the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill, and has expressed an unqualified opinion. output: INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had an investment in a wholly-owned subsidiary that has a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets.

For example, changes in labor laws or environmental regulations in countries where our suppliers operate could increase the cost of goods sold or impact our ability to source materials. In addition, we may be unable to manage our supply chain effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. Effective supply chain management requires visibility into our suppliers' operations, which can be challenging, particularly in countries with limited transparency or regulatory oversight.\n\nOur supply chain may be subject to disruptions, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, or cyber-attacks. These disruptions could impact our ability to meet customer demand, maintain our reputation for quality and reliability, and achieve our financial objectives. We have business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of potential disruptions, but the effectiveness of these plans may depend on various factors, including the severity of the disruption and the responsiveness of our suppliers and logistics providers.\n\nIn conclusion, our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with environmental, health and safety, and social regulations, as well as the use of third-party logistics providers and the management of our supply chain. While we have policies and programs in place to mitigate these risks, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of these risks on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects.

In 2023, we expect the rate of employee turnover to continue to be higher than our historical average rate of 5.5%. Specifically, we anticipate that employee turnover will range between 6.5% and 7.5% in 2023, with the majority of turnover expected to occur in the first half of the year. We have experienced higher than normal levels of employee turnover in our higher-wage markets, including our corporate offices and higher-wage service center locations.

These efforts include the implementation of flexible scheduling, telecommuting options, and employee recognition programs. Additionally, we have increased our focus on employee development and training, providing opportunities for career advancement and professional growth. We expect these efforts to continue to help to reduce employee turnover in 2023. However, our ability to reduce employee turnover may be negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including the overall competitive labor market, changes in the demand for our services, and the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the factors mentioned above, we have experienced a significant increase in our operating expenses as a result of our efforts to improve the quality of our services and to grow our business. These increases have been driven by a variety of factors, including higher labor costs, higher transportation costs, and increased costs for supplies and equipment. For example, our labor costs have increased by approximately 8% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher wages and increased overtime. Our transportation costs have also increased by approximately 10% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher fuel costs and increased transportation volumes. We expect these increases to continue to negatively impact our operating results in 2023. We expect our operating expenses to increase by approximately $200 million in 2023 compared to 2022, with the majority of the increase expected to occur in the first half of the year.\n\nIn addition to the increases in our operating expenses, we have experienced an increase in our capital expenditures in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily as a result of our efforts to improve the quality of our services and to grow our business. We expect our capital expenditures to increase by approximately $100 million in 2023 compared to 2022, with the majority of the increase expected to occur in the second half of the year.

We expect the cost of fuel to increase by approximately 10% in 2023 compared to 2022, with the majority of the increase expected to occur in the first half of the year. Additionally, we expect our other energy costs, including electricity and natural gas, to increase by approximately 5% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nWe have implemented a number of measures to mitigate the impact of the increases in the cost of fuel and other energy costs, including fuel surcharges and fuel hedging contracts.

Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in significant legal liability and harm to our reputation.\n\nFor example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union imposes stringent data protection requirements on companies that operate in the EU or offer goods or services to EU residents. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in significant fines and penalties, as well as reputational damage. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States imposes certain obligations on companies that collect personal data from California residents, including requirements related to data disclosure, access, and deletion.

The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate revolving credit commitments of $1.25 billion and aggregate term loan commitments of $1.5 billion. The Credit Agreement also provides for the ability of the Registrant to request additional commitments to the Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions and limitations.

The Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including covenants with respect to the Registrant\u2019s consolidated interest coverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio, and consolidated total net leverage ratio. The consolidated interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of the Registrant\u2019s consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) to its consolidated interest expense.

In addition, the Credit Agreement provides that the Lenders may terminate the Credit Agreement in the event of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which is defined to include, among other things, the failure to make payments when due under the Credit Agreement, the failure to perform or observe any covenant or other provision of the Credit Agreement, the occurrence of certain specified bankruptcy or insolvency events, the failure to pay certain judgments or orders, and the occurrence of a change in control of the Registrant. In the event of a termination of the Credit Agreement, the Registrant would be required to repay all outstanding loans and other obligations under the Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees.\n\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain provisions related to the payment of interest and fees. The Registrant is required to pay interest on outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the applicable base rate, plus (ii) a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.50%, depending on the Registrant\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio.

The Registrant believes that the Credit Agreement will provide it with the necessary liquidity and flexibility to support its business operations and growth initiatives.

In addition, we may be required to post collateral or enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate certain risks associated with our investments in non-convertible debt securities.\n\nWe are subject to various risks related to our investments in and exposure to the credit markets. Our investments in and exposure to the credit markets involve various risks, including the risk of default by the obligor, the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of prepayment, the risk of credit rating migration, and the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks. These risks are heightened in times of economic uncertainty, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be exacerbated by the actions of central banks and governments in response to the pandemic, including changes in monetary policy and the implementation of fiscal stimulus programs. In addition, the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration may be increased by the current market conditions. These risks may result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn particular, the risk of default by the obligor may be heightened in cases where the obligor is experiencing financial difficulties or is subject to significant industry or market disruptions. The risk of credit rating downgrades may also be increased in cases where the credit rating agencies revise their rating methodologies or adjust their ratings in response to changes in market conditions. Furthermore, the risk of prepayment may be heightened in cases where interest rates decline, causing borrowers to refinance or prepay their loans at a faster rate than expected.\n\nWe are also subject to the risk of credit rating migration, which occurs when the credit rating of an obligor is upgraded or downgraded by a credit rating agency. This can result in a change in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge. In addition, we are subject to the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks, which can result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge.\n\nWe are subject to various risks related to our investments in and exposure to the mortgage-backed securities market. Our investments in and exposure to the mortgage-backed securities market involve various risks, including the risk of default by the obligor, the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of prepayment, the risk of credit rating migration, and the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks. These risks are heightened in times of economic uncertainty, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be exacerbated by the actions of central banks and governments in response to the pandemic, including changes in monetary policy and the implementation of fiscal stimulus programs. In addition, these risks may be increased by the current market conditions.\n\nThe mortgage-backed securities market is also subject to specific risks, including the risk of delinquencies and defaults on the underlying mortgages, the risk of declines in the value of the underlying properties, and the risk of changes in the regulatory environment. These risks may result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe risks associated with our investments in and exposure to the mortgage-backed securities market may be further heightened in the event of changes in the laws or regulations affecting the mortgage-backed securities market, including changes that could affect the value of our mortgage-backed securities investments or that could cause us to recognize an impairment charge. For example, changes in the laws or regulations governing the origination and securitization of mortgages could affect the value of our mortgage-backed securities investments.\n\nWe also face the risk that the mortgage-backed securities market may experience a decline in liquidity, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our investments or to obtain financing. This could result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge.\n\nIn order to mitigate these risks, we engage in ongoing monitoring and analysis of our investments and the credit markets, and we may adjust our investment strategies and hedging arrangements as necessary. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, and we may still be subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\n\nWe also have exposure to other types of debt securities, including corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and asset-backed securities. These investments are subject to similar risks as our investments in non-convertible debt securities and mortgage-backed securities, including the risk of default by the obligor, the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of prepayment, the risk of credit rating migration, and the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks.\n\nOur investments in corporate bonds are subject to the risk of default by the issuer, as well as the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration. Our investments in municipal bonds are subject to the risk of default by the issuer, as well as the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration. Our investments in asset-backed securities are subject to the risk of default by the obligor, as well as the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration.\n\nIn addition, our investments in these debt securities are subject to the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks, which can result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge.

The offering closed on June 15, 2022.\n\nThe securities were offered to the Investors in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Investors were each an accredited investor and each acquired the securities in reliance on the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The securities were sold to the Investors at a price equal to 95% of the closing price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 15, 2022.\n\nThe Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company and the Investors. The Company has agreed to indemnify the Investors against certain losses resulting from breaches of its representations and warranties.

The Company believes that the additional capital provided by the sale of the Common Stock will enable it to accelerate its growth plans and improve its competitive position in the market.\n\nThe securities sold under the Purchase Agreement have been issued and delivered to the Investors. The Company has filed a current report on Form 8-K containing the Purchase Agreement and other information required under the Securities Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on June 16, 2022. The Form 8-K filing includes the following exhibits: (i) the Purchase Agreement; (ii) a press release announcing the transaction; and (iii) a copy of the opinion of the Company\u2019s counsel regarding the validity of the shares of Common Stock issued in the transaction.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, the Company has agreed to pay certain fees and expenses, including placement agent fees, legal fees, and other transaction costs. The aggregate amount of these fees and expenses is approximately $5 million, which will be deducted from the gross proceeds of the sale of the Common Stock.\n\nThe Company has evaluated the accounting treatment of the transaction and has determined that the sale of the Common Stock will be recorded as an equity transaction. The proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock will be recorded as an increase to the Company\u2019s additional paid-in capital.\n\nThe Company\u2019s management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in connection with the transaction and has determined that the transaction does not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, the Company\u2019s board of directors has determined that the sale of the Common Stock is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The board of directors has also determined that the terms of the Purchase Agreement are fair to the Company and its stockholders.\n\nThe sale of the Common Stock does not change the Company\u2019s business strategy or its long-term goals. The Company remains committed to its mission of providing high-quality products and services to its customers and to creating value for its stockholders. The additional capital provided by the sale of the Common Stock will enable the Company to accelerate its growth plans and improve its competitive position in the market.\n\nThe information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. output: ITEM 8.01.

The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock under this repurchase program during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\n\nThe repurchase program is intended to provide the Company with flexibility to manage its capital structure and return value to shareholders.

The repurchase program may be implemented through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated share repurchase agreements. The Company may also use Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases under the program.\n\nThe Company's accounting policy for share repurchases is to record the cost of repurchased shares as a reduction of shareholders' equity. The Company records the repurchased shares at the time of the transaction, and any shares repurchased are immediately retired. The excess of the repurchase price over the par value of the shares is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $10,000,000 of authorization remaining under the repurchase program.

The Company will continue to evaluate its capital structure and may consider repurchasing shares under the program in the future, subject to its financial position, capital requirements, and other factors.\n\nIn addition to the repurchase program, the Company may also repurchase shares of its common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units or other equity awards. These repurchases are not part of the authorized repurchase program and are instead intended to satisfy the Company's obligation to withhold taxes on behalf of its employees.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had 25,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, with a par value of $0.01 per share.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our business, and we continue to feel the effects of the ongoing pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic's impact on our business and financial results, as well as the impact of any future outbreaks, is uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty. This uncertainty makes it challenging for us to forecast our future financial performance and to make informed decisions about investments and resource allocation.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business, we have implemented various measures, including business continuity plans, travel restrictions, and protocols to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus within our facilities. These measures have helped us to maintain operations and to continue serving our customers, albeit with some disruptions. We are continuing to closely monitor the situation and may take additional actions to protect our employees, customers, and business. These actions may include further restrictions on travel, increased use of remote work arrangements, and enhanced safety protocols.\n\nOur global supply chain is another area where we face significant risks. The pandemic has caused widespread disruptions in global supply chains, leading to delays and shortages in the supply of certain products, including raw materials and components. We have experienced these disruptions firsthand, and we expect to continue to face challenges in this area. To address these challenges, we have implemented business continuity plans that are designed to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. These plans include identifying alternative sources of supply, working closely with our suppliers to manage inventory and shipping, and developing contingency plans for critical components.\n\nDespite these efforts, we may still experience delays and shortages in the supply of certain products and components. The pandemic has highlighted the fragility of global supply chains, and we are working to develop more resilient and flexible supply chain arrangements. This includes diversifying our supplier base, investing in supply chain visibility and analytics, and developing strategic partnerships with key suppliers. While these efforts are underway, we may still face challenges in this area, and we may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn addition to the pandemic, our business is also subject to risks associated with global climate change. The risks associated with global climate change, including the impact of increased regulation, taxes, and other measures to address climate change, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are monitoring the evolving landscape of climate change regulations and are taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint and to prepare for the potential impacts of climate change on our business. This includes investing in renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, and developing more sustainable supply chain practices.\n\nThe impact of global climate change on our business and financial results is uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty. However, we recognize that climate change is a significant risk that requires proactive management and planning. We are committed to reducing our environmental impact and to developing more sustainable business practices. This includes setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in clean technologies, and promoting sustainable practices throughout our supply chain.\n\nGlobal health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, are another area where we face significant risks. We have experienced delays and shortages in the supply of certain products, including raw materials and components, as a result of global health crises. We have implemented business continuity plans to mitigate the impact of global health crises and are working closely with our suppliers to manage inventory and shipping. We are also working to develop alternative sources of supply for critical components and to invest in supply chain resilience.\n\nWhile we have made significant progress in managing the risks associated with global health crises, we recognize that these events are inherently unpredictable and may have a significant impact on our business and financial results. We are committed to maintaining a proactive and flexible approach to managing these risks, including investing in supply chain visibility and analytics, developing strategic partnerships with key suppliers, and promoting a culture of safety and resilience throughout our organization.\n\nIn conclusion, our business operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those associated with global economic and political uncertainty, disruptions in global supply chains, global climate change, and global health crises. We are committed to managing these risks proactively and to developing more resilient and sustainable business practices. While the future is inherently uncertain, we are confident that our focus on risk management, supply chain resilience, and sustainability will help us to navigate the challenges ahead and to achieve our long-term goals.\" output: \"Our business operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those associated with global economic and political uncertainty, as well as disruptions in global supply chains.

Integrating and operating acquired businesses requires significant management attention and resources. The process of integrating an acquired business can be complex, and we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in a timely manner or at all.
