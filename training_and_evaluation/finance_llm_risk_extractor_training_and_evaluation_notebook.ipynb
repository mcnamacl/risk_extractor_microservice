This budget allocation is intended to support our strategic growth initiatives, including investments in research and development, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions.\\n\\nOur cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $3.5 billion, which was lower than the $4.4 billion generated in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $1.2 billion decrease in cash generated from operations related to changes in our working capital accounts. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including the $1.2 billion increase in accrued expenses, as well as a decrease in our accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in our cash generated from the sale of our investments. The increase in accrued expenses was largely driven by higher costs associated with our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses.\\n\\nOur cash flow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $(1.5) billion, which was higher than the $(1.3) billion generated in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the $1.5 billion purchase of our 9.8% ownership interest in TCI. This investment is expected to provide strategic benefits and potential long-term returns on investment. We also invested $200 million in various other investments, including venture capital funds and minority equity stakes in emerging technology companies.\\n\\nOur cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $(1.2) billion, which was lower than the $(1.4) billion generated in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the $1.1 billion decrease in cash dividends paid to our stockholders. We also repaid $300 million of debt during the year, which reduced our outstanding debt balance and associated interest expense. Additionally, we repurchased $400 million of our common stock under our share repurchase program, which reduced our outstanding share count and returned value to our stockholders.\\n\\nWe expect to continue to generate cash from operations and use it to fund our business needs, including funding our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses, as well as repaying debt and funding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We also expect to continue to return value to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend policy is to pay a regular quarterly dividend that reflects our financial performance and cash generation, while also considering our future business needs and growth opportunities.\\n\\nWe expect to continue to generate cash from operations in the future, but the amount of cash generated will depend on a number of factors, including the level of demand for our products and services, the level of capital expenditures, the level of research and development spending, the level of investments in our businesses, the level of debt repayment, and the level of funding of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to borrow funds to meet our business needs, including funding our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses.\\n\\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed to ensure that we have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to meet our business needs, including funding our growth initiatives and investments in our businesses. We maintain a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility that provides us with access to additional liquidity if needed. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand, which provides us with flexibility to respond to changing business conditions and opportunities.\\n\\nWe regularly review our capital allocation strategy to ensure that we are allocating our capital in a way that maximizes long-term value for our stockholders. This includes evaluating opportunities to invest in our businesses, return value to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and reduce our debt and associated interest expense. We believe that our capital allocation strategy is aligned with our business objectives and will help us achieve our long-term goals.\\n\\nOur pension and other postretirement benefit plans are an important consideration in our capital allocation strategy. We have a significant obligation to fund these plans, which requires us to make regular contributions to ensure that the plans are adequately funded. In 2023, we contributed $500 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and we expect to contribute a similar amount in 2024. We believe that our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are an important part of our overall compensation and benefits package, and we are committed to ensuring that they are adequately funded to meet the needs of our employees and retirees.\" output: \", and $1.4 billion of the 2023-2025 budget for the three-year period from 2023 through 2025. This budget allocation is intended to support our strategic growth initiatives, including investments in research and development, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions.\\n\\nOur cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $3.5 billion, which was lower than the $4.4 billion generated in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $1.2 billion decrease in cash generated from operations related to changes in our working capital accounts. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including the $1.2 billion increase in accrued expenses, as well as a decrease in our accounts receiv'}, {'categories': ['INVALID'], 'summary': 'INVALID', 'output': 'Extract financial risks. Output as [CATEGORIES] | SUMMARY input: ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nThe Company has a significant exposure to foreign currency risk primarily due to the Company’s international operations and its use of foreign currencies for transactions, including foreign currency denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and certain intercompany transactions. The Company’s foreign currency exposure is primarily to the Euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, and the Chinese Renminbi. The Company uses foreign currencies to fund its international operations and to settle transactions with foreign counterparties.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $4.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, which are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates would result in a change in the fair value of the Company’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $420 million and $330 million, respectively.\\n\\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are used to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company’s operating results. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts of approximately $1.1 billion, with an average maturity of approximately 12 months. The notional value of these contracts represents the maximum amount of foreign currency that the Company is obligated to purchase or sell at the specified exchange rate. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\\n\\nIn addition to foreign currency forward contracts, the Company also enters into foreign currency options to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s foreign currency options are not designated as hedges and are used to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company’s operating results. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign currency options of approximately $1.1 billion, with an average maturity of approximately 12 months. The Company’s foreign currency options give the Company the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell foreign currencies at a specified exchange rate. The Company’s foreign currency options are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\\n\\nThe Company is also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to its variable rate debt and its investments in floating rate securities. The Company’s variable rate debt includes its revolving credit facilities and term loans, which are subject to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding variable rate debt of approximately $2.5 billion, with an average interest rate of 4.5%. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would result in a change in the Company’s interest expense of approximately $25 million per year.\\n\\nTo manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps. The Company’s interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges and are used to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s operating results. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps of approximately $1.4 billion, with an average maturity of approximately 12 months. The notional value of these swaps represents the maximum amount of interest that the Company is obligated to pay or receive at the specified interest rate. The Company’s interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\\n\\nThe Company’s sensitivity analysis is based on a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis is based on the current level of outstanding contracts and is based on the assumption that the contracts will remain outstanding for the next 12 months. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the following table:\\n\\n|  | Hypothetical 10% Change |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Foreign Currency Denominated Assets | $420 million |\\n| Foreign Currency Denominated Liabilities | $330 million |\\n| Interest Expense | $25 million |\\n\\nThe Company believes that its use of foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps is effective in managing its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. However, the Company’s use of these financial instruments does not eliminate the risk of foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s use of these instruments will be effective in the future.\\n\\nThe fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps is estimated using widely accepted valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes model for options and the income approach for forward contracts and swaps. The inputs to these models are observable market data, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, and are subject to changes in market conditions. The Company believes that its estimates of fair value are reasonable and are based on the best available information. However, the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments is subject to changes in market conditions and may not be indicative of the actual value that the Company would receive if it were to settle these instruments.\\n\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk is monitored and managed by the Company’s treasury department, which is responsible for identifying and mitigating financial risks. The Company’s treasury department uses a variety of tools, including financial models and market data, to monitor and analyze the Company’s exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. The Company’s treasury department also works closely with the Company’s business units to understand their financial risks and to develop strategies to mitigate those risks.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Company is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risk due to its international operations and use of foreign currencies and variable rate debt. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to these risks. While the Company believes that its use of these financial instruments is effective in managing its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that the Company’s use of these instruments will be effective in the future. output: ITEM 7A.

Revenue Recognition\\n\\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it is earned and satisfies the following criteria: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fees are fixed or determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company considers revenue earned when the customer takes possession of the goods or when services are completed. Revenue is recorded at the amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\\n\\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when the products are shipped to customers, and the Company has a signed sales agreement or purchase order from the customer that includes the terms of the sale, including the price and payment terms. Revenue from services is recognized as the services are performed, and the Company has a signed services agreement or statement of work that outlines the scope of the work, the price, and payment terms.\\n\\nThe Company also generates revenue from licensing agreements, which is recognized over the term of the license agreement based on the terms of the agreement. Revenue from royalties is recognized when earned, based on the terms of the royalty agreement.\\n\\nThe Company records revenue net of sales taxes, returns, and discounts. The Company also records revenue from sales of extended warranties and maintenance agreements over the term of the agreement.\\n\\nB. Cash and Cash Equivalents\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company\\'s cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in checking and savings accounts with reputable financial institutions.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s cash and cash equivalents also include amounts held in money market funds, which are highly liquid and low-risk investments that are designed to preserve principal while providing liquidity. The Company\\'s money market funds are primarily invested in commercial paper and other low-risk investments.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s cash and cash equivalents are recorded at fair value, which is the amount that the Company could receive in exchange for those assets in the market. The Company does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk associated with its cash and cash equivalents.\\n\\nC. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\n\\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the net amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience of doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is written off against the related accounts receivable when it is determined that the account balance is unlikely to be collected. The Company also considers the creditworthiness of its customers, industry trends and current economic conditions in determining its allowance for doubtful accounts.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s allowance for doubtful accounts was $12.5 million and $14.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to the improvement in the credit quality of the Company\\'s customers and the overall economic conditions.\\n\\nThe Company also has a reserve for returns and discounts, which is recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable. The reserve for returns and discounts is based on the Company\\'s historical experience and is recorded at the time of sale.\\n\\nD. Inventories\\n\\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company also maintains a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical experience and management\\'s judgment of future demand for the products.\\n\\nThe Company reviews its inventories regularly to identify any excess or obsolete items. The Company considers factors such as inventory levels, sales trends, and changes in customer demand when determining whether inventory is excess or obsolete. The Company writes off inventory that is deemed excess or obsolete, and the cost is recorded as a charge to cost of sales.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s inventories are primarily composed of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. The Company\\'s inventory levels are managed to meet customer demand while minimizing the risk of excess or obsolete inventory.\\n\\nE. Property, Plant and Equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 40 years. The Company also maintains a reserve for asset retirement obligations.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s property, plant and equipment are primarily composed of machinery and equipment, buildings and improvements, and vehicles. The Company\\'s assets are depreciated based on their estimated useful lives, and the depreciation expense is recorded as a charge to operating expenses.\\n\\nThe Company also has a program to maintain and upgrade its property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalizes costs associated with the upgrade and maintenance of its assets, and the costs are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\\n\\nF. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\n\\nGoodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their fair value and are not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may be impaired. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the Company records an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\\n\\nThe Company also tests intangible assets for impairment at the individual asset level. Intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then the Company records an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s goodwill and intangible assets are primarily composed of acquired trademarks, patents, and customer relationships. The Company\\'s goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their fair value, which is determined based on the acquisition price and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\" output: \"A.

As of December 31, 2022, $4.3 billion of the $5.0 billion of 2022 notes remained outstanding. The notes that were repaid in 2022 were settled primarily through cash payments, with a minor portion being exchanged for other debt instruments with more favorable terms.\\n\\nWe also issue commercial paper, which is generally used to finance our short-term working capital requirements. We have issued commercial paper of up to $10.0 billion in aggregate principal amount. As of December 31, 2022, $5.6 billion of commercial paper was outstanding. This commercial paper is primarily used to fund our operational needs, such as inventory and accounts receivable, and we generally repay these borrowings within a short period, typically within 90 days. The interest rates on our commercial paper are determined by market conditions and our credit rating, and we closely monitor our commercial paper borrowings to minimize the costs of these financings.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $13.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $2.3 billion of cash held in foreign subsidiaries. The cash held in foreign subsidiaries is generally used to fund our international operations and is subject to certain repatriation restrictions and foreign withholding taxes. We also had $12.3 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, which provides us with additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations as needed. We believe our liquidity, including our cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity, is sufficient to meet our current and projected short-term and long-term financial obligations. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity in the future to meet our long-term financial obligations or that our financial obligations will not exceed our cash and cash equivalents or our available borrowing capacity.\\n\\nOur cash flows from operating activities are influenced by a number of factors, including our operating performance, the timing of capital expenditures, and the level of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities. We generate cash from the sale of our products and services, and our primary use of cash is to fund our operations and make capital expenditures. We use cash generated from our operations to fund our capital expenditures, including the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We also use cash generated from our operations to fund our research and development activities, which are critical to our long-term growth and competitiveness.\\n\\nIn 2022, our cash flows from operating activities were $10.5 billion, which was primarily driven by our net income of $8.5 billion and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization of $2.2 billion. We also generated $1.3 billion of cash from the sale of certain assets and businesses, which was partially offset by $0.5 billion of cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures in 2022 were $3.5 billion, which was primarily focused on investing in our manufacturing capabilities and technology infrastructure.\\n\\nWe expect our cash flows from operating activities to continue to be influenced by a number of factors, including the timing of capital expenditures, the level of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities, and the level of our cash dividends to shareholders. Our ability to generate cash from our operations is influenced by a number of factors, including the level of demand for our products and services, the level of our operating income, and the level of our capital expenditures. We closely monitor our cash flows and adjust our capital expenditures and dividend payments as needed to ensure that we maintain a strong liquidity position.\\n\\nWe believe that our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and projected financial obligations for the next twelve months. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows from operating activities in the future to meet our financial obligations or that our financial obligations will not exceed our cash flows from operating activities. We regularly review our cash flows and liquidity position to ensure that we have sufficient funds to meet our financial obligations and to invest in our business to drive long-term growth.\\n\\nIn addition to our cash flows from operating activities, we also have access to various sources of financing, including our credit facilities and the debt capital markets. We have a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poor\\'s and A3 from Moody\\'s, which provides us with access to the debt capital markets at favorable interest rates. We closely monitor our credit ratings and take steps to maintain a strong credit profile, which is critical to our ability to access the debt capital markets and to maintain our liquidity position.\\n\\nOverall, we believe that our strong liquidity position, combined with our ability to generate cash from our operations and access to various sources of financing, will enable us to meet our current and projected financial obligations and to invest in our business to drive long-term growth.\" output: \"Our cash flows from operating activities were $10.5 billion, which was primarily driven by our net income of $8.5 billion and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization of $2.2 billion.

The Company’s ability to maintain relationships with its customers is critical to its success, as a significant portion of its revenue is derived from a relatively small number of large customers. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the price of oil, natural gas, and other commodities, which may impact the Company’s operating results, including its ability to recover costs and maintain profitability. The Company is also affected by the impact of inflation on its operating expenses and the availability of financing, which may impact its ability to maintain its current level of operations. For example, an increase in the price of oil could lead to higher production costs, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability. Similarly, an increase in inflation could lead to higher operating expenses, which could also negatively impact the Company’s profitability.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro and the Chinese Yuan. The Company has significant operations in Europe and Asia, and changes in the value of the US dollar relative to these currencies can impact the Company’s revenue and expenses. For example, a strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro could lead to lower revenue from European operations, as the Company’s products and services become more expensive for European customers.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, on the Company’s operations, including the impact on the Company’s supply chain and the availability of financing. The Company has significant operations in the UK and Europe, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to volatility in the financial markets and a decline in the value of the British pound. This could lead to higher costs for the Company, particularly with respect to its supply chain, and could also impact the Company’s ability to access financing.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on the Company’s supply chain, the availability of financing, and the impact on the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions in the global economy, including widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, and supply chain disruptions. This has impacted the Company’s ability to obtain raw materials and maintain relationships with its customers, and has also led to a decline in demand for the Company’s products and services.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company’s business, including the impact of changes in the Company’s business mix, including the impact of the Company’s recent acquisitions and divestitures. The Company has made significant changes to its business in recent years, including the acquisition of several new businesses and the divestiture of others. These changes have impacted the Company’s revenue and expenses, and have also led to significant integration costs.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company’s financial position, including the impact of changes in the Company’s debt and equity, and the impact of changes in the Company’s cash flow, including the impact of changes in the Company’s capital expenditures. The Company has significant debt and equity obligations, and changes in the Company’s financial position can impact its ability to access financing and maintain its current level of operations.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company’s tax position, including the impact of changes in the Company’s effective tax rate, and the impact of changes in the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and changes in tax laws and regulations can impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nThe Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the impact of changes in the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and the impact of changes in the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit assets. The Company has significant pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and changes in the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans can impact its financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nIn addition to these factors, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company’s accounting policies and procedures, including the impact of changes in the Company’s revenue recognition policies, and the impact of changes in the Company’s expense recognition policies. The Company is subject to numerous accounting standards and regulations, and changes in these standards and regulations can impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are also affected by the impact of changes in the Company’s internal controls and procedures, including the impact of changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and the impact of changes in the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company is subject to numerous regulations and standards related to internal control and disclosure, and changes in these regulations and standards can impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are affected by a wide range of factors, including fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the Company’s business mix, changes in the Company’s financial position, changes in the Company’s tax position, changes in the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, changes in the Company’s accounting policies and procedures, and changes in the Company’s internal controls and procedures. These factors can impact the Company’s ability to maintain its current level of operations, and can also impact the Company’s ability to access financing and maintain its relationships with its customers. output: of the Company’s products, services, and operations, including its ability to maintain relationships with its customers, to obtain and maintain adequate supply of raw materials, and to successfully integrate its acquisitions.

These risks may be exacerbated by climate change. In addition, certain of our operations are located in areas that are prone to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods, and may be more susceptible to damage or disruption as a result. For example, our facilities in coastal regions may be at a higher risk of flooding and storm surges, while our operations in areas with high seismic activity may be more vulnerable to earthquakes. In addition, the occurrence of such events could result in damage to our facilities, interruption of our supply chain, loss of our employees and other personnel, and other disruptions to our business. We may not be able to recover from such events in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, any of these events could result in a loss of our key personnel, which could harm our business.\\n\\nIn particular, our manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and other critical infrastructure may be at risk of damage or disruption due to natural disasters or other catastrophic events. If any of these facilities are damaged or destroyed, we may not be able to operate at full capacity, or at all, until repairs or replacements can be made. This could result in significant losses, including lost revenue, increased costs, and potential liability for any resulting harm to our customers, employees, or other stakeholders. Furthermore, if we are unable to restore our operations quickly, our customers may seek alternative suppliers, which could lead to long-term losses of business and revenue.\\n\\nIn addition, we may experience a loss of business or reputational harm if we fail to adequately respond to any such events or if we fail to prevent or mitigate the impact of any such events. For example, if we fail to implement adequate emergency response plans, or if our response to a disaster is perceived as inadequate or insensitive, we may face criticism and reputational damage. In addition, any of these events could result in a significant increase in the cost of insurance coverage for our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The occurrence of such events may also impact the availability and cost of materials, labor, and supplies necessary to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For instance, if a natural disaster disrupts the supply chain for critical components or raw materials, we may face increased costs or shortages, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.\\n\\nThe occurrence of such events may also cause a significant increase in the cost of capital, including the cost of debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, if investors perceive our business as being at higher risk due to the occurrence of a catastrophic event, they may demand higher returns on investment, which could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\\n\\nWe have not maintained adequate insurance coverage for certain risks that may impact our business. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate or sufficient to cover our losses or damages if any of these events occur. For example, we may not have adequate coverage for business interruption, cyber-attacks, or other types of losses that could result from a catastrophic event. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or may be unable to obtain such coverage at a reasonable cost. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we may be subject to material losses, including potential liability for the cost of any such events, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\\n\\nIn particular, we may not have adequate insurance coverage for losses related to climate change, such as sea level rise, more frequent or severe weather events, or other climate-related risks. As climate change continues to evolve and intensify, we may face increased risks and uncertainties, including physical risks to our facilities and operations, as well as transition risks related to changes in regulations, technologies, and market conditions.\\n\\nFurthermore, even if we do have adequate insurance coverage, we may still face significant costs and disruptions in the event of a catastrophic event. For example, we may need to pay deductibles, coinsurance, or other expenses out of pocket, which could be significant. Additionally, we may face delays or disputes with our insurers, which could impact our ability to recover losses or damages in a timely manner.

Our ability to refinance our debt may also be impacted by the creditworthiness of our subsidiaries, the value of the collateral securing our debt, and the willingness of lenders to provide financing.\\n\\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt or to refinance our debt as it matures, we may be forced to take certain actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing or eliminating dividends, or selling assets. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, we may be forced to accept terms that are less favorable than our existing debt, which could increase our interest expense and reduce our cash flows.\\n\\nAs of the date of this Form 10-Q, we have taken various steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including the implementation of business continuity plans and remote work arrangements. However, the pandemic is ongoing, and its impact on our business and operations is uncertain and may continue to evolve.

We will continue to closely monitor our cash flows and debt levels and take steps to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $1,320, which were comprised of deferred tax assets of $1,831, offset by deferred tax liabilities of $511. The deferred tax assets were primarily related to depreciation and amortization, accruals and reserves, and net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax liabilities were primarily related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\\n\\nThe Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized, and to the extent that realization is not considered more likely than not, a valuation allowance is established.

The state and local tax rates are applied to the Company's taxable income in each jurisdiction, resulting in a blended state and local tax rate of 4.2%, 4.1%, and 4.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\n\\n- Foreign taxes: The Company is subject to foreign taxes in various jurisdictions, which range from 0% to 25%. The foreign tax rates are applied to the Company's taxable income in each jurisdiction, resulting in a blended foreign tax rate of 0%, 0%, and 0% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\n\\n- Permanent differences: The Company has permanent differences between its financial statement income and taxable income, primarily related to nondeductible executive compensation, non-qualified stock options, and certain types of income that are not subject to tax.\\n\\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022, was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the benefit of the gain on the sale of a subsidiary, which was recorded in 2022. The gain on the sale of a subsidiary was subject to a lower tax rate than the U.S. federal statutory rate, resulting in a lower effective income tax rate for the year.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1,135 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized, would favorably affect the Company's effective income tax rate. The gross unrecognized tax benefits were primarily related to the deductibility of certain expenses, the classification of certain transactions, and the valuation of certain assets. The Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefits of open tax years in the financial statements in the period in which the benefits are realized or forfeited.

The Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities for the years 2019 through 2022. The Company does not believe that there are any material positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that would result in the recognition of a liability for interest and penalties.\\n\\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1,135 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized, would favorably affect the Company's effective income tax rate.\\n\\nThe Company's management assesses the available evidence to estimate whether some or all of the gross unrecognized tax benefits will be realized. The Company's management considers, among other factors, the guidance provided by ASC 740, the technical merits of its tax positions, and the potential settlement of tax audits and examinations.

This increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $11.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the three months ended December 31, 2023 related to the settlement of a tax audit.\\n\\nThe discrete tax benefit recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2023 was the result of a settlement with a taxing authority, which reduced the Company's tax liability for prior years. This settlement was reached after an audit of the Company's tax returns for the years 2018 through 2020. The settlement resulted in a reduction of tax reserves of $11.3 million, which was recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the three months ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 24.1%, compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the recognition of discrete tax benefits of $11.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the settlement of a tax audit and the release of a valuation allowance of $3.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\nThe valuation allowance release of $3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the Company's reassessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized, resulting in the release of the valuation allowance. This release was recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 23.6%, compared to 23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance of $11.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2021, which was offset by the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $11.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the settlement of a tax audit.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state tax reserves of $16.1 million, $5.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which represent the Company's estimate of the liability for uncertain tax positions. These reserves are based on the Company's assessment of the likelihood of sustaining its tax positions, taking into account the technical merits of the positions, the applicable tax laws and regulations, and the potential settlement or litigation outcomes.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state tax reserves of $16.1 million, $5.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The slight increase in state tax reserves from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was due to changes in state tax laws and regulations, which resulted in an increase in the Company's estimated liability for uncertain tax positions.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $2.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $2.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\\n\\nThe Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods based on various factors, including changes in tax laws and regulations, the outcome of tax audits and settlements, and the realization of deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to monitor these factors and adjust its tax reserves and valuation allowances accordingly.\\n\\nIn addition to the tax reserves and valuation allowances discussed above, the Company also has deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $23.4 million, compared to net deferred tax assets of $20.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in net deferred tax assets was primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets related to the settlement of a tax audit and the release of a valuation allowance.\\n\\nThe Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company does not expect to realize the majority of its deferred tax assets within the next 12 months, and therefore, has classified them as non-current.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Company's effective tax rate for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 was influenced by various factors, including the recognition of discrete tax benefits and the release of valuation allowances. The Company will continue to monitor its tax positions and adjust its tax reserves and valuation allowances accordingly. output: ’s effective tax rate, the tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was 25.2%, compared to 24.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties in income tax expense and the related tax benefit in the provision for income taxes.\\n\\nThe evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The second step is to measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions at each reporting period and adjusts the unrecognized tax benefit accordingly.\\n\\nThe Company has not recognized any tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements related to any tax loss carryforwards that are subject to the 80% limitation of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).

Specifically, the Company must deliver to the Lenders certain documents, including, but not limited to, a certificate of the Company\\'s secretary certifying the resolutions adopted by the Company\\'s board of directors authorizing the execution, delivery, and performance of the Agreement, as well as a certificate of the Company\\'s chief financial officer certifying that the Company has complied with the conditions precedent to closing set forth in the Agreement.\\n\\nThe Company intends to use the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding debt under its existing credit facilities, including the Company’s revolving credit facility and the Company’s term loan B, and for general corporate purposes. The repayment of the Company\\'s outstanding debt will allow the Company to reduce its overall debt burden and free up additional liquidity for future business opportunities.\\n\\nThe Term Loan Facility contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00, a leverage ratio of 5.50 to 1.00 and a total net leverage ratio of 5.50 to 1.00, measured quarterly, subject to certain exceptions. The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the Company\\'s consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Agreement) by its consolidated fixed charges (as defined in the Agreement), and the leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio are calculated by dividing the Company\\'s consolidated total debt (as defined in the Agreement) by its consolidated EBITDA.

In the event of a default, the Lenders may accelerate the Term Loan Facility, which would require the Company to immediately repay all outstanding principal, interest, and fees under the Term Loan Facility.\\n\\nThe Company has also agreed to pay certain fees in connection with the Term Loan Facility, including, but not limited to, a commitment fee, a funding fee, and an administrative agent fee. The commitment fee is equal to 0.50% per annum of the unused portion of the Term Loan Facility, the funding fee is equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, and the administrative agent fee is equal to $50,000 per annum.\\n\\nThe foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\\n\\nAs part of the Agreement, the Company has also entered into a security agreement (the \"Security Agreement\") with the Lenders, pursuant to which the Company has granted a lien on certain of its assets, including, but not limited to, its accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The Security Agreement requires the Company to maintain certain insurance coverage with respect to its assets and to comply with certain other obligations.\\n\\nIn addition, the Company has entered into an intercreditor agreement (the \"Intercreditor Agreement\") with the Lenders and certain other creditors of the Company, which governs the relative rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the Term Loan Facility and certain other debt obligations of the Company.

This liability is not subject to being returned to the plans and is expected to be paid from available cash.\\n\\nThe actuarial interest on the excess cash is calculated based on the average yield on high-quality corporate bonds over the preceding 12-month period. This rate is subject to change based on market conditions, and any changes in this rate can impact our liability for actuarial interest.

The Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the approval of the merger by the Company’s shareholders and the receipt of required regulatory approvals.\\n\\nThe Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including a non-solicitation covenant. The non-solicitation covenant restricts the Company from soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions that allow the Company to consider and engage in discussions with respect to certain unsolicited alternative acquisition proposals that the Company’s Board of Directors determines are, or are reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Merger Agreement also includes a termination fee payable by the Company in certain circumstances, including if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal or if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain the required shareholder approval and a competing acquisition proposal is consummated within a certain period.\\n\\nThe Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger. The Company has not yet filed the proxy statement and related proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the solicitation of shareholder approval of the Merger. The Company expects to file the proxy statement and related proxy materials with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2022.\\n\\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Gurnet Point has agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock for a cash purchase price of $X per share. The total consideration to be paid by Gurnet Point in connection with the Merger is estimated to be approximately $Y million, based on the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s net working capital, cash, and indebtedness at the time of closing.\\n\\nThe Merger Agreement also includes provisions for the treatment of outstanding equity awards granted under the Company’s equity incentive plans. Under these provisions, outstanding options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the excess of the purchase price over the exercise price of the option, and outstanding restricted stock units will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the purchase price.\\n\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and has recommended that the Company’s shareholders approve the Merger.

Prior to the Amendment, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation required the approval of at least two-thirds of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock to approve certain corporate actions, including mergers and acquisitions. The Amendment reduces this threshold to a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, which is consistent with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\\n\\nThe Amendment will become effective in connection with the closing of the Merger. At that time, the Company’s Board of Directors will be reconstituted to consist of three classes of directors, with the members of each class serving for a term of three years. The directors who will comprise the reconstituted Board of Directors have been designated by Gurnet Point, and will include a combination of existing members of the Company’s Board of Directors and new directors designated by Gurnet Point.\\n\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the Amendment is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and has recommended that the Company’s shareholders approve the Merger, which includes the adoption of the Amendment.

This information is provided in the tables below.\\n\\n| Production Costs | Cost of Sales | Selling, General and Administrative Expenses |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Labor | $1,000,000 | $500,000 | $200,000 |\\n| Overhead | $500,000 | $200,000 | $100,000 |\\n| Materials | $200,000 | $100,000 | $50,000 |\\n| Other | $100,000 | $50,000 | $25,000 |\\n\\nThe Company's policy is to capitalize all costs related to the production of products and services, including labor and overhead, and to expense such costs as they are incurred. The Company believes that this approach provides a more accurate representation of its financial position and performance, and is consistent with accounting standards and regulatory requirements.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, the Company expenses the costs of advertising and marketing campaigns when incurred. These costs are recorded as expenses on the income statement, rather than being capitalized as assets. The Company believes that this approach is consistent with the nature of these expenses, which are typically incurred in the short-term and do not provide long-term benefits.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Company's policy is to capitalize all costs related to the production of products and services, including labor and overhead, and to expense such costs as they are incurred. The Company believes that this approach provides a more accurate representation of its financial position and performance, and is consistent with accounting standards and regulatory requirements. output: Excerpt (Expanded):\\n\\nThe Company's capitalization policy is applied consistently across all product and service categories.

These legal proceedings and other claims are often unpredictable and subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and there can be no assurance that the Company will ultimately prevail on any claims or disputes that are pending or threatened against it. The outcome of any such legal proceeding or other claim could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\\n\\nThe Company may be required to pay significant amounts in connection with these legal proceedings and other claims, including damages, fines, penalties, and other costs. In addition, the Company may be required to devote significant time and resources to defending itself against these claims, which could divert the attention of the Company’s management and other personnel away from its business operations. The Company may also be required to make changes to its business operations or products in order to comply with any judgments or settlements that may be entered against it, which could also have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Company’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the costs and expenses associated with these legal proceedings and other claims. The Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, including product liability claims and environmental and health and safety claims. However, the Company’s insurance coverage is subject to certain limits and exclusions, and the Company may not have coverage for all types of claims or for all amounts that it may be required to pay in connection with these claims. In addition, the Company’s insurance premiums may increase significantly if it is subject to a large number of claims or if it is required to pay significant amounts in connection with these claims.\\n\\nIn light of these risks and uncertainties, the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these legal proceedings and other claims or the impact that they may have on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

See Note 1, “Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our accounting policies.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $5.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and $4.6 billion of debt. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months, including funding our expected cash requirements for capital expenditures, debt repayment, and other obligations. See Note 5, “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our debt and Note 8, “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our investments.\\n\\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are primarily held in the United States, with a small portion held in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our foreign-held cash is denominated in U.S. dollars or other major currencies and can be repatriated to the United States without significant restrictions. However, we do have some cash and investments held in countries with currency controls or other restrictions that may limit our ability to access these funds in the short term.\\n\\nIn addition to the matters discussed in Note 1, “Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, we believe the following are material factors that could impact our liquidity:\\n\\n• Capital expenditures: We expect to continue to invest in new and existing products, technologies, and infrastructure, including investments in our digital transformation initiatives, to support our growth strategy. Our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be around $1.4 billion, which includes investments in new and existing products, technologies, and infrastructure, as well as investments in our digital transformation initiatives. The majority of these expenditures will be focused on expanding our digital capabilities, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing customer experience. We expect to fund these expenditures primarily through cash generated from operations.\\n\\n• Debt repayment: We expect to repay debt through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our debt repayment plan is expected to be around $1.4 billion for 2024. We have a mix of short-term and long-term debt with varying interest rates and maturity dates. Our debt repayment plan is designed to manage our debt levels and reduce our interest expense over time.\\n\\n• Dividend payments: We have a history of paying quarterly dividends. The amount of our quarterly dividend is determined by our Board of Directors, which considers our earnings, cash flow, and other factors in making such determination. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in 2024, but the amount and timing of these dividends will depend on our financial performance and other factors.\\n\\n• Discretionary spending: We may need to reduce discretionary spending to maintain our financial flexibility if our cash flows are impacted by any factors, including changes in the level of our capital expenditures, changes in our business environment, or changes in our financial performance. Discretionary spending includes items such as marketing and advertising expenses, research and development expenses, and other non-essential operating expenses. We have a flexible budgeting process that allows us to adjust our discretionary spending in response to changes in our business or financial performance.\\n\\n• Interest rates: Interest rates could increase, which could increase our interest expense and reduce our ability to make debt repayments. We have a mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, which helps to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on our interest expense. However, if interest rates were to increase significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\\n\\n• Economic conditions: Economic conditions could deteriorate, which could negatively impact our business and cash flows. We operate in a number of industries and geographies, which helps to diversify our revenue streams and reduce our exposure to economic downturns in any one area. However, if there were a broad-based economic downturn, it could have a material impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\\n\\n• Regulatory actions: Regulatory actions could impact our business and cash flows. We are subject to a number of regulations and laws in the countries where we operate, and changes in these regulations or laws could require us to make significant investments or changes to our business. We have a robust compliance program in place to help us manage regulatory risks, but if there were a significant change in regulations or laws, it could have a material impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\\n\\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, combined with our expected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months. However, we will continue to monitor our liquidity and adjust our plans as needed to ensure that we have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations and invest in our business.\\n\\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, we also have a number of other liquidity management strategies in place, including:\\n\\n• Cash pooling: We have a cash pooling arrangement in place that allows us to manage our cash and cash equivalents across our global operations. This arrangement helps us to optimize our cash flows and reduce our reliance on short-term borrowings.\\n\\n• Revolving credit facility: We have a revolving credit facility in place that provides us with access to additional liquidity if needed. This facility has a variable interest rate and can be drawn upon at any time.\\n\\n• Investment management: We have an investment management strategy in place that helps us to manage our investments and optimize our returns. This strategy includes a mix of short-term and long-term investments, as well as a diversified portfolio of asset classes.\\n\\nWe believe that our liquidity management strategies, combined with our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, will help us to manage our liquidity and meet our financial obligations over the next 12 months.\\n\\nSee Note 5, “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our debt and Note 8, “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our investments.

The Company has no material obligations that mature in less than one year, except for normal trade payables, accrued expenses, and other liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. These liabilities are typically settled within a short period, usually 30 to 90 days, and are not considered a significant strain on the Company's liquidity.\\n\\nThe Company's $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which expires in March 2027, provides an essential source of liquidity to support its operations and strategic initiatives. The revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a leverage ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a total net worth covenant, which are designed to ensure that the Company maintains a prudent level of debt and maintains its financial health. The Company is in compliance with these covenants and regularly reviews its financial position to ensure that it remains in compliance.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, the revolving credit agreement contains a springing maturity provision that requires repayment of outstanding borrowings if the Company's consolidated total net worth falls below $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's consolidated total net worth exceeded $5.0 billion, providing a comfortable cushion against this provision.\\n\\nThe Company had $0.3 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2022, and $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity. This provides the Company with significant flexibility to respond to changing business conditions and capitalize on strategic opportunities. In addition to the revolving credit agreement, the Company also has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit agreement. Although the Company has not borrowed under the commercial paper program, it provides an additional source of liquidity and increases the Company's overall borrowing capacity.\\n\\nThe commercial paper securitization program is another essential component of the Company's liquidity management strategy. This program allows the Company to issue commercial paper notes to investors in exchange for cash collateral, which is backed by the revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper notes and had $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under the commercial paper securitization program.\\n\\nIn addition to its borrowing capacity, the Company also manages its exposure to foreign currencies through various foreign currency exchange agreements. These agreements are not designated as hedging instruments and are not effective hedges for accounting purposes. However, they help to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the Company's financial results.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a notional value of $1.2 billion. These contracts are used to manage the Company's exposure to certain foreign currencies and are not designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nThe Company has also entered into foreign currency option contracts to manage its exposure to certain foreign currencies.

The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to an increase in net income and an increase in non-cash items, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable and other current assets. The increase in net income was driven by improved operating performance across our business segments, particularly in our core operations. The increase in non-cash items was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to new asset additions and investments.\\n\\nThe decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to improved payment terms with our suppliers and the settlement of certain outstanding liabilities.

The increase in proceeds from the sale of assets was driven by the joint venture sales mentioned earlier, as well as the sale of certain non-core assets.

The increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility was driven by our need to fund working capital requirements and support our growth initiatives.

These risks may affect the Company\\'s ability to maintain its pricing power, manage its costs, and ensure the timely delivery of its products to customers.

If demand for these products were to decline significantly, the Company may need to reduce production levels, which could result in higher costs per unit and lower profitability. Furthermore, the Company\\'s reliance on a limited number of products may limit its ability to respond to changes in market conditions or customer preferences, which could negatively impact its competitiveness and market share.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on a limited number of customers, including the impact of changes in demand from these customers on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows, as well as the impact of the Company’s reliance on these customers on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its debt obligations. The loss of any of these customers or a significant reduction in their demand for the Company\\'s products could have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the Company\\'s reliance on a limited number of customers may limit its ability to negotiate favorable pricing and terms, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.\\n\\nIn addition to these risks, the Company is also subject to risks related to its supply chain, including the potential for disruptions, delays, or cost increases. The Company relies on a network of suppliers and manufacturers to produce and deliver its products, and any disruptions to this network could impact the Company\\'s ability to meet customer demand and maintain its pricing power. Furthermore, the Company\\'s supply chain may be subject to risks related to labor practices, environmental sustainability, and compliance with laws and regulations, which could negatively impact the Company\\'s reputation and brand.\\n\\nThe Company is also subject to risks related to its debt obligations, including the potential for increased interest rates, debt service costs, and refinancing risks. The Company\\'s debt obligations may limit its ability to invest in its business, pursue strategic opportunities, and respond to changes in market conditions, which could negatively impact its competitiveness and market share.

The Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, but this growth has been accompanied by rising inflation, increasing labor costs, and a highly competitive business environment. These factors can affect the Company’s ability to maintain its pricing power, manage its costs, and achieve its sales and revenue targets in China. Furthermore, the Chinese government has implemented various policies to regulate the economy, including policies related to foreign investment, currency exchange, and trade. These policies can impact the Company’s business operations in China and its ability to repatriate earnings from its Chinese subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nThe Company’s results of operations and financial position are affected by the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Furthermore, the Company is subject to various regulatory requirements and laws in the countries in which it operates, including laws related to taxation, employment, and data protection. These laws can impact the Company’s business operations and its ability to achieve its financial targets. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nThe Company’s results of operations and financial position are also affected by the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly for raw materials and components used in its products. The Company may enter into commodity price hedging contracts or other derivatives to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations. However, these hedges may not be effective in offsetting the impact of commodity price fluctuations on the Company’s financial results. Furthermore, the Company is subject to various supply chain risks, including the risk of supplier insolvency, natural disasters, and transportation disruptions. These risks can impact the Company’s ability to obtain the raw materials and components it needs to manufacture its products, which can affect its sales and revenue targets.\\n\\nThe Company’s results of operations and financial position are also affected by the Company’s ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies. The Company invests significant resources in research and development, and its ability to develop new products and technologies is critical to its future success. However, the development of new products and technologies is a complex and uncertain process, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its innovation efforts.\\n\\nIn addition, the Company’s results of operations and financial position are affected by the Company’s exposure to various legal and regulatory risks. The Company is subject to various laws and regulations, including laws related to product safety, employment, and data protection. These laws can impact the Company’s business operations and its ability to achieve its financial targets. Furthermore, the Company is subject to various litigation risks, including product liability claims, employment disputes, and intellectual property disputes. These risks can impact the Company’s financial results and its ability to achieve its business objectives.\\n\\nOverall, the Company’s results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors, including its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, commodity price fluctuations, supply chain risks, innovation risks, and legal and regulatory risks.

These foreign subsidiaries are primarily located in countries with lower tax rates than the United States. We have not provided for U.S. federal income taxes on these foreign earnings as we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign operations. If these earnings were to be repatriated, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\\n\\nOur tax-deferred investments in subsidiaries of $2.0 billion are primarily related to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. These investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and are subject to U.S. federal income tax when the earnings are repatriated or distributed to us.

These tax liabilities are expected to be settled in the next 12 months through a combination of cash payments and the application of available tax credits. We do not expect to recognize a significant portion of these tax liabilities in the next three years. However, changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations, or changes in our operations or financial position, could result in the recognition of these tax liabilities in the future.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $1.3 billion of tax benefits, primarily related to foreign tax credits and U.S. federal tax credits. These tax benefits are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and are available to reduce our future U.S. federal income tax liabilities. The U.S. federal tax benefits of $1.3 billion are available to reduce our future U.S. federal income tax liabilities when U.S. federal income taxes are paid on previously untaxed income. We expect to use these tax benefits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax liabilities in future periods, but the utilization of these benefits may be limited by U.S. federal tax laws and regulations.\\n\\nOur tax attributes related to our foreign operations, including foreign tax credits, foreign tax losses, and foreign tax deductions, are subject to limitations under U.S. federal tax laws and regulations.

As of December 31, 2022, we had contingent tax liabilities of approximately $200 million related to these audits and examinations. We do not expect to recognize a significant portion of these contingent tax liabilities in the next three years. However, changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations, or changes in our operations or financial position, could result in the recognition of these contingent tax liabilities in the future.\\n\\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to tax liabilities in income tax expense.

These increases were primarily due to the decline in our operating results, including a decline in gross profit and operating income due to lower revenues and higher costs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\\n\\nThe decline in gross profit was largely driven by decreased sales volumes and lower average selling prices in certain product lines, as well as higher raw material and manufacturing costs. The decline in operating income was further impacted by increased research and development expenses and higher selling, general, and administrative costs. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies, which reduced the value of our foreign-denominated revenues and earnings.\\n\\nCash flows provided by (used for) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, which included investments in new manufacturing facilities, equipment, and technology, as well as the sale of assets, including the divestiture of a non-core business. These increases were partially offset by higher cash paid for investments, including strategic investments in emerging technologies and partnerships.\\n\\nThe capital expenditures were primarily focused on enhancing our manufacturing capabilities, improving operational efficiency, and supporting the development of new products and services. We expect these investments to drive long-term growth and profitability. The sale of assets was part of our ongoing effort to optimize our portfolio and focus on core businesses.\\n\\nCash flows used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2.5 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher dividends paid to shareholders, reflecting our commitment to returning value to our investors, and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock, which was impacted by market conditions and our decision to prioritize share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of debt, which included the issuance of long-term bonds to refinance existing debt and support our capital structure.\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our subsidiaries outside the United States. We have access to additional cash and cash equivalents through our credit facilities, which had a total outstanding balance of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our credit facilities are comprised of a revolving credit agreement and a term loan agreement, both of which mature in 2027. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.1 billion of outstanding commercial paper, which is used to support our short-term liquidity needs.\\n\\nWe expect to use cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations and make capital expenditures, and we expect to refinance our commercial paper and debt as it matures. We have a long history of generating strong cash flows from operations, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our ability to generate cash from operations is driven by our diversified business portfolio, our strong market positions, and our focus on operational efficiency.\\n\\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. We have repurchased 15.2 million shares of our common stock under this authorization since inception, including 1.5 million shares of our common stock repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2024. We have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this authorization since December 31, 2023. We may repurchase additional shares under this authorization at any time.\\n\\nWe expect to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under this authorization in the future, subject to market conditions and other factors, and we may adjust the level of repurchases based on our cash flow generation, capital allocation priorities, and market opportunities. We believe that share repurchases are an effective way to return value to our shareholders and to offset the dilutive impact of share-based compensation.\\n\\nIn addition to share repurchases, we also prioritize dividend payments as a way to return value to our shareholders. We have a long history of paying consistent and growing dividends, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our dividend policy is subject to review and adjustment by our Board of Directors, and we may adjust our dividend payments based on our cash flow generation, capital allocation priorities, and market conditions.\\n\\nOverall, we believe that our strong cash flow generation, diversified business portfolio, and disciplined capital allocation strategy position us well to drive long-term growth and profitability, and to return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.\" output: \"and $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company has concluded that the fair value of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2023. The Company has also concluded that there was no impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s goodwill and intangible assets primarily arose from the acquisition of its wholly-owned subsidiary. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2023, was $150.8 million and $75.2 million, respectively. The Company\\'s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, trademarks, and licenses. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2023, was $50.5 million.\\n\\nThe Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment test for goodwill involves a two-step process. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit\\'s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by subtracting the fair value of the reporting unit\\'s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit.\\n\\nThe Company has concluded that the fair value of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2023. The fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach involves estimating the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with those cash flows. The market approach involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit or asset based on comparable market transactions.\\n\\nThe Company has also concluded that there was no impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2023. The Company\\'s indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no intangible assets that were being amortized. The Company\\'s intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\\n\\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2023:\\n\\n|  | Goodwill | Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Balance at January 1, 2023 | $150.8 million | $50.5 million |\\n| Acquisitions | - | - |\\n| Impairment losses | - | - |\\n| Balance at December 31, 2023 | $150.8 million | $50.5 million |\\n\\nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization expense for the Company\\'s intangible assets that were being amortized as of December 31, 2023:\\n\\n| Year | Estimated Amortization Expense |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| 2024 | $- |\\n| 2025 | $- |\\n| 2026 | $- |\\n| 2027 | $- |\\n| 2028 | $- |\\n\\nThe Company\\'s intangible assets and goodwill are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in customer demand, competition, and economic conditions.

However, if the Company\\'s estimates of future cash flows or other assumptions used in the impairment analysis were to change, it is possible that an impairment loss could be recognized in the future.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s accounting policy for intangible assets and goodwill is to recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

This global sourcing strategy may expose us to risks associated with international trade, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in trade policies, and logistical challenges.\\n\\nWe may not be able to maintain our current level of supply chain diversity, and our supply chain may be subject to disruptions. Supply chain disruptions could result from various factors, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, or supplier insolvency. In the event of a disruption, we may need to identify alternative suppliers or logistics providers, which could be time-consuming and costly. In addition, our third-party logistics providers may not be able to maintain our current level of service or may not be able to provide the level of service we expect. This could impact our ability to meet customer demand and maintain our reputation for quality and reliability.\\n\\nOur third-party logistics providers and suppliers may be subject to laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. For example, changes in labor laws or environmental regulations in countries where our suppliers operate could increase the cost of goods sold or impact our ability to source materials. In addition, we may be unable to manage our supply chain effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. Effective supply chain management requires visibility into our suppliers\\' operations, which can be challenging, particularly in countries with limited transparency or regulatory oversight.\\n\\nOur supply chain may be subject to disruptions, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, or cyber-attacks. These disruptions could impact our ability to meet customer demand, maintain our reputation for quality and reliability, and achieve our financial objectives. We have business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of potential disruptions, but the effectiveness of these plans may depend on various factors, including the severity of the disruption and the responsiveness of our suppliers and logistics providers.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with environmental, health and safety, and social regulations, as well as the use of third-party logistics providers and the management of our supply chain. While we have policies and programs in place to mitigate these risks, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of these risks on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects.

These efforts include the implementation of flexible scheduling, telecommuting options, and employee recognition programs. Additionally, we have increased our focus on employee development and training, providing opportunities for career advancement and professional growth.

These increases have been driven by a variety of factors, including higher labor costs, higher transportation costs, and increased costs for supplies and equipment. For example, our labor costs have increased by approximately 8% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher wages and increased overtime. Our transportation costs have also increased by approximately 10% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher fuel costs and increased transportation volumes. We expect these increases to continue to negatively impact our operating results in 2023. We expect our operating expenses to increase by approximately $200 million in 2023 compared to 2022, with the majority of the increase expected to occur in the first half of the year.\\n\\nIn addition to the increases in our operating expenses, we have experienced an increase in our capital expenditures in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily as a result of our efforts to improve the quality of our services and to grow our business.

Our capital expenditures have been focused on investments in new technology, equipment, and facilities, as well as the expansion of our service offerings.\\n\\nOur operating results have been negatively impacted by the significant increases in the cost of fuel and other energy costs. We have experienced significant increases in the cost of fuel and other energy costs in 2023 compared to 2022, and we expect these increases to continue to negatively impact our operating results in 2023. We expect the cost of fuel to increase by approximately 10% in 2023 compared to 2022, with the majority of the increase expected to occur in the first half of the year. Additionally, we expect our other energy costs, including electricity and natural gas, to increase by approximately 5% in 2023 compared to 2022.\\n\\nWe have implemented a number of measures to mitigate the impact of the increases in the cost of fuel and other energy costs, including fuel surcharges and fuel hedging contracts. However, our ability to mitigate the impact of these increases may be limited by a variety of factors, including the overall volatility of the energy markets, changes in the demand for our services, and the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor the energy markets and adjust our strategies as necessary to minimize the impact of these increases on our operating results.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our operating results in 2023 are expected to be negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including higher employee turnover, increased operating expenses, and higher energy costs. However, we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these factors, including implementing measures to reduce employee turnover, investing in new technology and equipment, and implementing fuel surcharges and fuel hedging contracts.

The Credit Agreement is not a guarantee of the obligations of the Registrant or any of its subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement.\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement is comprised of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate revolving credit commitments of $1.25 billion and aggregate term loan commitments of $1.5 billion. The Credit Agreement also provides for the ability of the Registrant to request additional commitments to the Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Specifically, the Registrant may request an increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments and/or the aggregate term loan commitments by an amount not to exceed $500 million, provided that the total aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement do not exceed $3.25 billion.\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Registrant’s ability to incur debt, make certain investments, incur certain liens, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including covenants with respect to the Registrant’s consolidated interest coverage ratio, consolidated leverage ratio, and consolidated total net leverage ratio. The consolidated interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of the Registrant’s consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) to its consolidated interest expense. The consolidated leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of the Registrant’s consolidated total debt to its consolidated EBITDA. The consolidated total net leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of the Registrant’s consolidated total net debt to its consolidated EBITDA. The Credit Agreement requires the Registrant to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00, a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, and a consolidated total net leverage ratio of not more than 4.00 to 1.00.\\n\\nIn addition to the financial covenants, the Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that the Registrant maintain a minimum consolidated cash balance of $200 million. The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, and indemnities made by the Registrant and certain of its subsidiaries. The representations and warranties include, among other things, representations as to the Registrant’s corporate existence and power, its authority to enter into the Credit Agreement, the validity and enforceability of the Credit Agreement, and the absence of any defaults or events of default under the Credit Agreement.\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement provides that the Lenders may terminate the Credit Agreement in the event that the Registrant fails to comply with any covenant or other provision of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides that the Lenders may terminate the Credit Agreement in the event of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which is defined to include, among other things, the failure to make payments when due under the Credit Agreement, the failure to perform or observe any covenant or other provision of the Credit Agreement, the occurrence of certain specified bankruptcy or insolvency events, the failure to pay certain judgments or orders, and the occurrence of a change in control of the Registrant. In the event of a termination of the Credit Agreement, the Registrant would be required to repay all outstanding loans and other obligations under the Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees.\\n\\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain provisions related to the payment of interest and fees.

In addition, we may be required to post collateral or enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate certain risks associated with our investments in non-convertible debt securities.\\n\\nWe are subject to various risks related to our investments in and exposure to the credit markets. Our investments in and exposure to the credit markets involve various risks, including the risk of default by the obligor, the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of prepayment, the risk of credit rating migration, and the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks. These risks are heightened in times of economic uncertainty, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be exacerbated by the actions of central banks and governments in response to the pandemic, including changes in monetary policy and the implementation of fiscal stimulus programs. In addition, the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration may be increased by the current market conditions. These risks may result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nIn particular, the risk of default by the obligor may be heightened in cases where the obligor is experiencing financial difficulties or is subject to significant industry or market disruptions. The risk of credit rating downgrades may also be increased in cases where the credit rating agencies revise their rating methodologies or adjust their ratings in response to changes in market conditions. Furthermore, the risk of prepayment may be heightened in cases where interest rates decline, causing borrowers to refinance or prepay their loans at a faster rate than expected.\\n\\nWe are also subject to the risk of credit rating migration, which occurs when the credit rating of an obligor is upgraded or downgraded by a credit rating agency. This can result in a change in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge. In addition, we are subject to the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks, which can result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge.\\n\\nWe are subject to various risks related to our investments in and exposure to the mortgage-backed securities market. Our investments in and exposure to the mortgage-backed securities market involve various risks, including the risk of default by the obligor, the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of prepayment, the risk of credit rating migration, and the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks. These risks are heightened in times of economic uncertainty, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be exacerbated by the actions of central banks and governments in response to the pandemic, including changes in monetary policy and the implementation of fiscal stimulus programs. In addition, these risks may be increased by the current market conditions.\\n\\nThe mortgage-backed securities market is also subject to specific risks, including the risk of delinquencies and defaults on the underlying mortgages, the risk of declines in the value of the underlying properties, and the risk of changes in the regulatory environment. These risks may result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nThe risks associated with our investments in and exposure to the mortgage-backed securities market may be further heightened in the event of changes in the laws or regulations affecting the mortgage-backed securities market, including changes that could affect the value of our mortgage-backed securities investments or that could cause us to recognize an impairment charge. For example, changes in the laws or regulations governing the origination and securitization of mortgages could affect the value of our mortgage-backed securities investments.\\n\\nWe also face the risk that the mortgage-backed securities market may experience a decline in liquidity, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our investments or to obtain financing. This could result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge.\\n\\nIn order to mitigate these risks, we engage in ongoing monitoring and analysis of our investments and the credit markets, and we may adjust our investment strategies and hedging arrangements as necessary. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, and we may still be subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\\n\\nWe also have exposure to other types of debt securities, including corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and asset-backed securities. These investments are subject to similar risks as our investments in non-convertible debt securities and mortgage-backed securities, including the risk of default by the obligor, the risk of credit rating downgrades, the risk of prepayment, the risk of credit rating migration, and the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks.\\n\\nOur investments in corporate bonds are subject to the risk of default by the issuer, as well as the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration. Our investments in municipal bonds are subject to the risk of default by the issuer, as well as the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration. Our investments in asset-backed securities are subject to the risk of default by the obligor, as well as the risk of credit rating downgrades and the risk of credit rating migration.\\n\\nIn addition, our investments in these debt securities are subject to the risk of interest rate and liquidity risks, which can result in a decline in the value of our investments and may cause us to recognize an impairment charge. We also face the risk that the market for these debt securities may experience a decline in liquidity, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our investments or to obtain financing.\\n\\nIn order to mitigate these risks, we engage in ongoing monitoring and analysis of our investments and the credit markets, and we may adjust our investment strategies and hedging arrangements as necessary.

Our efficiency ratio of 63.3% for the quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and improve our expense structure. We also continued to make progress on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, including our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and our commitment to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion across our organization.”\\n\\nNet Interest Income\\n\\nNet interest income for the quarter was $9.4 billion, down $83 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in interest income from loans and investment securities, partially offset by an increase in interest income from trading assets. The net interest margin was 2.02%, down 5 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by a decline in the yield on earning assets.\\n\\nNoninterest Income\\n\\nNoninterest income for the quarter was $7.8 billion, down $214 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment fees, and other income.

The allowance for credit losses was $14.5 billion, up $550 million from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the consumer and commercial portfolios.\\n\\nEfficiency Ratio\\n\\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.3%, down 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by a decline in noninterest expenses. Noninterest expenses were $10.6 billion, down $417 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower salaries, benefits, and other expenses.\\n\\nReturn on Average Common Equity\\n\\nThe return on average common equity for the quarter was 12.3%, up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in net income.\\n\\nCapital and Liquidity\\n\\nWells Fargo’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. The company’s liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 134%, up 5 percentage points from the second quarter of 2022.\\n\\nESG Initiatives\\n\\nWells Fargo continued to make progress on its ESG initiatives, including its goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The company has set a goal to increase diversity in its workforce and has implemented various initiatives to achieve this goal, including diversity and inclusion training, mentorship programs, and diversity and inclusion metrics.\\n\\nBusiness Segments\\n\\nWells Fargo’s business segments include Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management.\\n\\nConsumer Banking and Lending\\n\\nNet income for the Consumer Banking and Lending segment was $2.4 billion, down $135 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net interest income and higher credit losses.\\n\\nCommercial Banking\\n\\nNet income for the Commercial Banking segment was $1.4 billion, up $85 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher net interest income and lower credit losses.\\n\\nCorporate and Investment Banking\\n\\nNet income for the Corporate and Investment Banking segment was $1.2 billion, down $45 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net interest income and higher noninterest expenses.\\n\\nWealth and Investment Management\\n\\nNet income for the Wealth and Investment Management segment was $844 million, up $53 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher net interest income and lower noninterest expenses.\\n\\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\nThis report contains forward-looking statements about Wells Fargo’s future financial performance and business.
