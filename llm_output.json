In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results and cash flow as a result of changes in the level of demand for our products and services, the level of our operating expenses, the amount and timing of our capital expenditures, the amount and timing of our acquisitions and divestitures, the level of our working capital requirements, the level of our accounts receivable and payable, and the level of our accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nSome of the key factors that contribute to the fluctuations in our operating results and cash flow include:\n\n*   The seasonality of our business, including the impact of holidays, weather patterns, and other seasonal factors on demand for our products and services;\n*   The cyclical nature of our industry, including the impact of economic downturns, changes in government regulations, and other factors on demand for our products and services;\n*   The level of competition in our market, including the impact of new entrants, changes in pricing and other competitive factors on our operating results;\n*   The level of our investment in research and development, including the impact of new product and service introductions on our operating expenses;\n*   The level of our investment in sales and marketing, including the impact of new marketing campaigns and other sales and marketing initiatives on our operating expenses.\n\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our operating results and cash flow in the past and may experience fluctuations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur ability to manage these fluctuations will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\n*   Develop and implement effective business planning and budgeting processes, including our ability to forecast our operating results and cash flow accurately;\n*   Maintain a strong balance sheet, including our ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations, invest in our business, and make strategic acquisitions;\n*   Manage our working capital requirements effectively, including our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions with our suppliers, partners, and other third parties;\n*   Develop and implement effective risk management processes, including our ability to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with our business.\n\nIf we are unable to manage these fluctuations effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the market.\n\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position in the market will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\n*   Innovate and develop new products and services, including our ability to identify emerging trends and technologies;\n*   Invest in research and development, including our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services;\n*   Attract and retain key personnel, including experienced management, sales and marketing, and technical professionals;\n*   Maintain our relationships with our suppliers, partners, and other third parties, including our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions.\n\nIf we are unable to maintain our competitive position in the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions and divestitures as part of our business strategy.

Regulation FD Disclosure.\n\nOn October 12, 2022, the Company issued a press release announcing its quarterly earnings for the period ended September 30, 2022. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.\n\nThe information set forth in this Item 7.01 is intended to be furnished in accordance with Item 7.01 of Regulation FD (17 CFR 243.7) and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.\n\nExhibit 99.1\n\nPress Release dated October 12, 2022\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2022\n\nWells Fargo & Company Reports Third Quarter 2022 Earnings\n\nMINNEAPOLIS – October 12, 2022 – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) today reported its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n\nSummary of Financial Results\n\n* Net income attributable to Wells Fargo of $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per common share of $1.13\n* Net revenue of $17.2 billion\n* Net interest income of $9.4 billion\n* Noninterest income of $7.8 billion\n* Credit losses of $1.2 billion\n* Efficiency ratio of 63.3%\n* Return on average common equity of 12.3%\n\nWells Fargo’s results for the third quarter of 2022 reflect the company’s continued focus on managing risk and improving efficiency while investing in the business to drive growth and profitability.\n\n“Wells Fargo’s third quarter results reflect the ongoing challenges we face in the current economic environment, including rising interest rates and inflation, which are impacting our customers and our business,” said Charlie Scharf, Wells Fargo’s CEO. “We continue to manage these risks while investing in our business to drive growth and profitability. Our efficiency ratio of 63.3% for the quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and improve our expense structure. We also continued to make progress on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, including our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and our commitment to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion across our organization.”\n\nNet Interest Income\n\nNet interest income for the quarter was $9.4 billion, down $83 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to a decrease in interest income from loans and investment securities, partially offset by an increase in interest income from trading assets. The net interest margin was 2.02%, down 5 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by a decline in the yield on earning assets.\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter was $7.8 billion, down $214 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment fees, and other income. Mortgage banking revenue was $1.3 billion, down $143 million from the second quarter of 2022, driven by lower mortgage origination and servicing revenue.\n\nCredit Losses\n\nCredit losses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up $215 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher credit losses in the consumer and commercial portfolios. The allowance for credit losses was $14.5 billion, up $550 million from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the consumer and commercial portfolios.\n\nEfficiency Ratio\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter was 63.3%, down 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by a decline in noninterest expenses. Noninterest expenses were $10.6 billion, down $417 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower salaries, benefits, and other expenses.\n\nReturn on Average Common Equity\n\nThe return on average common equity for the quarter was 12.3%, up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in net income.\n\nCapital and Liquidity\n\nWells Fargo’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. The company’s liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 134%, up 5 percentage points from the second quarter of 2022.\n\nESG Initiatives\n\nWells Fargo continued to make progress on its ESG initiatives, including its goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The company has set a target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and has implemented various initiatives to achieve this goal, including increasing its use of renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, and promoting sustainable transportation.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWells Fargo is committed to increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion across its organization. The company has set a goal to increase diversity in its workforce and has implemented various initiatives to achieve this goal, including diversity and inclusion training, mentorship programs, and diversity and inclusion metrics.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nWells Fargo’s business segments include Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management.\n\nConsumer Banking and Lending\n\nNet income for the Consumer Banking and Lending segment was $2.4 billion, down $135 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net interest income and higher credit losses.\n\nCommercial Banking\n\nNet income for the Commercial Banking segment was $1.4 billion, up $85 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher net interest income and lower credit losses.\n\nCorporate and Investment Banking\n\nNet income for the Corporate and Investment Banking segment was $1.2 billion, down $45 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net interest income and higher noninterest expenses.\n\nWealth and Investment Management\n\nNet income for the Wealth and Investment Management segment was $844 million, up $53 million from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher net interest income and lower noninterest expenses.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements about Wells Fargo’s future financial performance and business. Because forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding the future, they are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties.
